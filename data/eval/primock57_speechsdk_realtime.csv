day1_consultation01_doctor,"Hello. Hi. Yeah. OK. Hello. Good morning. How can I help you this morning? Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. And when you say diarrhoea, what do you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose? OK. And how many times a day are you going, let's say over the last couple of days? 6-7 times a day and you mentioned this mainly water tree. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? OK. And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Whereabouts is the pain exactly? One side. And what side is that? That's right. OK. And can you describe the pain to me? OK. And there's a pain. Is that is it there all the time or does it come and go? Does the pain move anywhere else because on between your back? OK, fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, have you been feeling feverish, for example? Measure your temperature then. OK OK. Any other symptoms like sweating or night? No. And any vomiting at all? You stop vomiting again and would you vomit? I know it's not nice thing to talk about but was it just normal food colour? Yeah. And there was no blood in your vomits, is that right? No. OK. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned the tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhoea, you mentioned the vomiting. Anything else that comes to mind? OK. OK, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat? Anything? OK, fine. And so we started three days ago. The symptoms, are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms to kick on? So for example, things like take away foods or eating out or being around other people who would similar symptoms? Thank you. Do you remember where you ate? OK anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? OK, OK, fine. Right. And in terms of your your overall health, are you normally fitting well or? OK. And did you asthma well controlled? MMM. And you don't have any other tummy problem? Bowel problems I should be aware of, no. OK. And apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? OK, fine. And in terms of just your your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. In what way has it been affecting your life? OK. Yeah. And have you are you currently working at the moment? Would work. OK. Have you been going into work the last three days? Have you been at home? OK, that must be difficult for you then. Right. And you said, you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? All right, just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? And do you drink much more of alcohol? OK, so. Normally at this stage I'd like to examine you if that's OK but but haven't listened to your stories. I think just to recap, for the last three days you've been having loose dual diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left hand side and vomiting and feeling quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you're having this Chinese take away as well three days ago and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something. Called gastroenteritis. Which essentially just the tummy bug or infection of your of your tummy. Mainly caused by viruses, but they can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage, what what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics is really just making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking plenty of fluids. There are things like diolite you can get from the pharmacy which it's it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would soon recommend that first, you know, first couple of days. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, 2 tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I'll certainly advise you to take some type of work. Actually I know you're quite keen to work. I would say next to two to three days as clears from your system. Just take some time off and rest. You know, if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms and we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your store so we can test that, etcetera, etcetera. How's that sound? Do you have any questions for me? OK. Is it, is the treatment plan clear? Great. Well, I wish you all the best. Thank you. Bye bye.","Hello? Hi. Um, should we start? Yeah, okay. Hello how um. Good morning sir, how can I help you this morning? Sorry to hear that. Um, and and when you say diarrhea, what'd you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often?

Left side. Okay, and can you describe the pain to me? Okay. And is the pain, is that, is it there all the time, or does it come and go? Come and go.

day1_consultation02_doctor,"Hello. Yes, I think it's a bit better. It's a bit, it's a bit. It's not very clear, but let's continue anyway. OK, let's start again. So how can I help you, Sir? OK. No, no problems, I'm happy to help. Whereabouts on your skin is it affected?  Yup. No, no, OK, I understand this is obviously affecting you and we'll try very best to get it sorted out for you. Have you had anything like this before in the past? OK. OK. Did it help? OK, OK. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? OK, OK. Would you say the symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different? OK. I. Yes. No. Well, OK, that's OK. So you mentioned the itchiness, you also mentioned it's been quite sore. Have you have you noticed any bleeding or discharge from your skins? OK. United any other pus or blood coming out of your skin. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Are you 4 days ago? Are you aware of any triggers or anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start? So for example, have you changed your shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone else?  No, no. OK, That's OK. Fine, so just to re summarise, for the last four days you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest and did you also mention your arms and legs as well? Menu. OK, anything on your face at all? On your face. No. OK. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? Itchy. OK so your your bowels are working OK. Your chest is OK, no cough, no breathing difficulties. You're passing urine, OK? OK. All right. It's always good to know. So I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? OK, that's OK. So normally at this stage I'd like to examine you to see the rash itself and see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well and it's been very itchy And so with your. Your background of eczema? So there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you which I completely forgot. My apologies. Apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? OK. Not anymore. OK. And do you take any regular medications at the moment? No. OK. Do you have any allergies to anything? Sorry, anything. Hello, can you hear me? Sorry, I think it do you have any allergies at all? No. OK. And tell me about your your situation at home. Who do you live with? OK. And what do you do for work? OK. No, no, no, that's absolutely, that's absolutely fine. Just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms is do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in a way of alcohol? OK. Okay, okay, I've got to say, at this stage I've got to say the sound quality is not great, but I will continue because we've come this far. So based on everything you mentioned, Sir, I do wonder whether this is a flare up of your eczema. The reason being that you said it's quite itchy. It's mainly affecting your chest and your back. And having looked at your skin, the rash does appear quite familiar. You mentioned using steroid creams yesterday. From the pharmacy, I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a steroid may be beneficial, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today, as well as I'm going to give you something, some emollients, which helps to moisturize the skin, which we want to use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth using that for the first seven to 10 days before we make a decision on whether it's working or not. It's also worth using antihistamines, which can sometimes buy over the counter. Things like loratadine or pyritin which can help with the itchiness of your skin. And it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms. Anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap. Because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about it next time I see you. Oh, could you say again sorry? OK. I didn't. OK, So it's something for you to think about. You can get different type of an system means I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well, something that effects Afenadine which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying. It's not going to do you any harm. But I say anything using the steroids and the emollients on a regular basis over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week if things don't get better. OK. Do you have any questions for me? OK, well I wish you all the best. Thank you. Have a good day.","Hello? Uh uh yes. I think. It's a bit better. It's a bit, it's a bit, it's not very clear. But let's continue anyway. Uh, OK. Let's start again. So how can I help you sir? OK. No, no problem. I'm happy to help. Um whereabouts in your skin is it affected? Yeah. No no, OK. I'm certain this is obviously affecting you. And uh we'll try our very best to get get this sorted out for you. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? OK. OK. Did it help? OK. OK. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? OK, steroid, OK. um would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms, or different? OK. Yes. No. Well OK. That's so you mentioned the itchiness. Um you also mentioned it's been quite sore. Um have you, have you noticed any uh bleeding or discharge from your skins? OK. You've not, haven't uh seen any other uh pus or blood, coming out of your skin. No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Are you, four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers, or anything that you may have done, that may have caused your symptoms to start? So for example, have you changed your uh shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone else? Mm. Mm. No no, OK. That's OK. Um Fine, so just to resummarize. For the last four days, you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest. And did you also mention your arms and legs as well? OK. anything on your face at all? On your face? No, OK. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? Itchy. OK. So your, your bowels are working OK?

Any ideas, as to what could be causing your symptoms? OK. That's OK. So um, normally at this stage I like to examine you. Um To see the rash itself, to see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's, you've got some dry skin and some, uh cracked skin as well. Uh and has been very itchy. And so would your um Uh your your background of eczema. Um So Sorry to say, there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot, my apologies. Um, apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? OK. Not anymore, OK. And do you take any regular medications at the moment? No, OK. Do you have any allergies to anything? sorry I said do you have any allergies to anything? Hello? can you hear me?

Uh no no no that's , that's absolutely fine. Um just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is, do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? OK. OK. OK I've got to say, at this stage I've got to say this sound quality is not uh great. But I will continue because we've come this far. Um So um, based on everything you mentioned Sarah , I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. Um The reason being that you said it was quite itchy.

So it's something for you to think about. you can get different types of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well. Um, something like Fexofenadine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, and it's not going to do you any harm. Um but I think using the steroids and the emollients, um on a regular basis Uh over the next week to ten days, should hopefully control your symptoms.

Well, let's try our best. Let's try and get you. Let's try and get you well soon. You mentioned this on your left hand side, is that right? And it started at midday a few hours ago. OK, Did a pain come on quite suddenly or was it more of a gradual build up? OK. And are you able to describe what kind of headache it was? For example, was this throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain? And is it moving anywhere else at all? OK. Is that when you move your neck? OK. OK. Is that what you're worried about? Is that is that what your main worry is today? Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. I can, I can understand why it's affecting you, but why don't we, why don't we take a good history 1st and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here. So you mentioned a few things. You mentioned the headaches. You also mentioned some zigzag lines before the headaches came on and your vision has been blurry as well. Is that right? Is that is that on both eyes or just a left, left eye? Both eyes. OK. Have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all? Oh, I see. OK. And you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous. Have you vomited at all? Oh, it's OK. This earlier today, OK Any temperatures or fevers? OK, any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed? OK. Point and do you normally get headaches? OK. And what happened then? How long did it last for? Did you do anything that made it better? Yeah. N. Yeah, yeah, there's no. Yeah, sure. And then I can see your concerns. Obviously there's a lot. There's no worry there. But you know, let's, let's take a step by step and see exactly what the cause of these headaches are. First, I'm just going to ask you some very yes, no questions. That's OK. Have you noticed any problems with your speech at all? Any difficulty words, any problems with your arms and legs, for example numbness or weakness, and any difficulty with balance, your balance or coordination? OK. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head? OK, all right. And and you're feeling otherwise. OK, So for example. Your your breathing is OK. You're not feeling breathless or. No. OK. Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No. So for example, if you had, if anyone told you've had migraines in the past, no. OK do you think? OK, right. So my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to brain for example? What was that? Sorry? Under expiry as well. OK. OK. Any other problems for example the brain or you mentioned brain cancer, any other family history of that? No. OK. In terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis? OK. And how long have you been on that for? Three months. OK. And is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? OK, alright. That's something we may have a little discussion about today as well. Well, my next question was about your social really your situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry. Is your work, is your job quite stressful at the moment? Have you been? Is it getting you down? OK. All right. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally? OK. Do you do much in a way of exercise? OK, who's at home with you? OK. Are you coping OK at the moment? Yeah, OK. Do you smoke at all? And do you drink much aware of alcohol? OK. All right. So normally I said I'd kind of proceed to examination. That's based on your story. I wonder whether you may may have a migraine. Migraine type headache it sounds. Very classical of that nature the the headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, sensitivity, bright lights. I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious, such as meningitis or indeed. Brain cancer and I was a big worry of yours initially. Yeah, yeah. We'll have to push your, you know, EM minor ES certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. So I think moving forwards there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary will be quite important to see exactly what's true in these headaches. But we should also try and treat your headaches today in some strong painkillers will be advisable. So, you know, I think about paracetamol or even Cocoda Mall. And some anti inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen. How does that sound to you? And you know, if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the 1st place. Something prophylactic medicines. We can have discussion next time I see you next week perhaps. OK, now a couple of things I want you to think about is you know, if your symptoms aren't getting better in next 2-3 days or indeed they're getting worse. I'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible. So if your headaches getting worse and not responding to medications or your your neck pain is getting worse or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision. I'm going to come back and see me straight away, OK? Does that sound all OK? Great. Any questions for me? OK, have a good day. All right.","Hello? Hello there. It's uh Doctor here.

It's not very painful, but it's sort of there all the time. Sorry. No, it's, it's, it's sort of, it's sort of constant. I forgot to mention that I'm also having night sweats. That's that's very odd actually, and sort of. Makes me retired. Makes my sleep with uneasy. Yes, yes. I, I had some, some fever in the beginning, but it's now sort of going down. I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen for that and they they help. So no pain in the chest, but I noticed that I. So I feel a bit winded on exertion. So if I I haven't been going going to the gym this because of that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. When, when, when I'm resting, it's OK. So I've been actually going to work and sort of managing.

day1_consultation05_doctor,"Hello. Good morning, Kim. How can I help you this morning? OK. Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When when did your symptoms all start? OK, and where about in your tummy is a pain exactly? OK. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual? OK, OK. And can you describe the pain to me? Justin, just blow your belly button you mentioned. OK. And is a pain constant or does it come and go? OK. And with the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So for example, let's let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working OK? OK, so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools? OK. And what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine? OK.  MMM. Can we mention pink urine? Was there any blood at all in urine or is it difficult to say? OK, all right. But otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pass urine. OK. OK. And moving up towards other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all? No one thing any temperatures or fevers. OK, fine. And came to ask, you know, all female patients, there's questions about your cycle. If you don't mind me asking, are you currently, are you currently sexually active? OK. So you've had no other partners since then? OK. And do you use any contraception at all? Implement. OK, fine. Are you still having periods? When was your last period? Two weeks ago. OK, so is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in bed. Is there any chance you could pretend to be pregnant? Something for us to think about. OK, well, it's unfortunate to think about maybe worth doing a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. OK and and so just to summarise so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days is tummy pain that's really affected you many lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning. You said it's getting worse, you know, some pink urine, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass your and your bowels are working. OK, You felt a little bit nauseous. I'm feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Is there anything else perhaps that you feel like you should share with me at this stage which you think might be important? Yeah, OK. Tell me, tell me a bit more about your medical history. Otherwise, are you normally fitting well? OK. Do you have anything like this before in the party? Similar symptoms? No, OK. Fine. Any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant family related? Related to bowels? Maybe Related to guiding history? OK, All right. And socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? OK. And are you currently working? What do you do for work? OK. Great. OK. Do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No, OK. OK, just before I go to examination, I just want to go through just some few screening questions. That's OK, yes or no? We've we've covered the majority of them already, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. How's your how's your chest? How's your breathing? OK any funny heartbeats or rhythms palpitations? OK. Any headaches? Any problems with your vision? No. OK. All right. Fine. OK, So really just moving on. So basically based on your story, really Kim, it's it's a it's a difficult one. It's it's. We know you've got some premier playing. We don't exactly know what's causing it. There could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. Could just be a, you know, it could just be a urine infection, for example. Could this be something related to your gut? Could this be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy related cause? And so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out what's going on here? Which I can organise for you today. And the based on those tests, we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed, but certainly. If it's been going on for the last couple of days. You know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for it maybe your infection so. Yeah, absolutely. So I think it's certainly worth, you know, covering you with some antibiotics today. But I still want you to bear in mind, you know, having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here. And and I wanted to kind of really come back and see him in a few days time if symptoms are not getting any better or indeed they're getting worse. So things to look out for would be, you know, worse than tummy pain. If you're feeling really hot and sweaty, the temperature's not coming down. Vomiting, etcetera. Does that make sense? OK, you can try just regular painkillers. Paracetamol will be advisable. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids. You can try some cranberry juice as well, which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Take the antibiotics and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else. Ya, but I'll send it straight to your pharmacy. Start the antibodies today, something called trimethoprin. We'll take 2 tablets, 1 tablet twice a day for three days. Let's say you get on. Great. All the best. Bye bye.","Hello? . Good morning, Tim. Um, how can I help you this morning? OK. Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When, when did your symptoms all start? OK.

Um, are you still having periods? When was your last period? Two week scare, OK. So, is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in there, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something for us to think about Yeah, OK. Well it's something for us to think about.

day1_consultation06_doctor,"Hello. Hello. Can you hear me OK? OK, great. I am. Yes. Doctor sued here, Oscar. How can I help you this afternoon? OK, June, tell me a bit more about when did it all start?  OK. OK, OK. Is there anything you're particularly worried about? OK. Right. Right. OK. So you mentioned you've been short of breath for the last couple of weeks, but maybe the last couple of days has got a bit worse? And you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal, minimal exertion you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all with your breath? So for example, any pain in your chest? OK, do you find yourself coughing? Coughing at all? OK. OK. And how's your general health otherwise? Are you feeling weak, lethargic. OK. OK. And what do you mean by that? OK, Is that is that both? Both ankles. OK, can imagine. Yeah. And again, over how long has this, have you noticed this for? Last few days, OK. And this is something that you've had before in the past. OK, OK. Fine. OK, so just to really recap, so you really in the last couple of weeks you've been feeling breathless but worse in the last couple of days you mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles importing no chest pain and and have you any, have you have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all? So palpitations or skipped heartbeat? OK. And any temperatures or fevers? OK, and how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking OK? OK. And your Water Works. Are you passing urine? OK? Yeah. Sure. OK. All right, fine. So moving on to your past medical history, you mentioned heart failure. Any, any other medical history I should be aware of? OK. OK. And when you when you say a small heart attack, did they give you a name for what happened, a name of a diagnosis? Angina or. OK. OK. OK. Even I guess it's an AK all right. So partly the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of? OK. Do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking? Do you know which ones? Do you know which days you're taking? One second, no problems. Any other medications? OK. That metoprolol was it? Or sorry, the connection is not very OK. Thank you. Yeah. Right. And was that an OK, all right, any allergies at all? Any medications? No. OK. And is there anything in the family that's that that's that's important for me to know any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems? I'm sorry to hear that. How old was your father when he passed away? 360 it's OK Anything else I should be aware of? OK. Is your mother still with us? OK, all right. And socially, Sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you? You got 2 cats? OK great. Do you have names? OK. So this is Junior Katz. And in terms of day-to-day, are you working at the moment? OK. And how is that like quite stressful long hours? MMM. Yeah, this is certainly a consideration, isn't there? So let's let's try and get you better soon. So it doesn't have any impact on your on your job. And do you find yourself doing a lot of antisocial hours or do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? Was it? OK, OK, all right. And what about smoking and alcohol? So because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. So do you smoke at all? So you used to smoke? And how many did you smoke a day on average? And how many, how many years was that for? OK, well done for stopping. I must be very difficult for you. The world up for stopping. And what about alcohol? OK. Do you do much in a way of exercise? OK, OK. Right, OK. And certainly now your symptoms, you you said you're feeling more breathless, even walking to the to the shop, she said right. So based on your based on your history and having listened to your story, I wonder whether you've had a flare up of your heart failure, Sir, we can sometimes happen. And you know, it's so I think that your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. And obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously it's the first thing that comes to my mind. Now there's a couple of options for us to move forward. Given that you otherwise were at the moment, and having examined you, your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all OK, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of frozen modes. Maybe rather than one tablet day, we can give you 2 tablets a day for the first few days and see and see how you're getting on. I think, I think it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping. Is that something you've had? Yeah. So an echo scan, it's a Jelly scan of your heart. You may have had it done before when you're diagnosed, and it's just to get a good. Sorry. OK, fine. That's something I can organise for you today. And it may take a week or two weeks for that to be organised. But I think certainly in the meantime, let's let's let's get a blood test done. We can check your, you know, your full blood can look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function. And we can definitely increase your, your freezer mind to, you know, 1 tablet twice a day. But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about weeks time, see how you're getting on. Does that sound reasonable? And of course, in the meantime, if you are getting more unwell, so if you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness, then you know said I want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well. OK. Do you have any questions for me? Great, now I wish you all the best. Have a good day. OK. Thank you.","Hello? Uh, hello. Can you hear me OK? OK, great. . I am, yes. Nice to see you here, Oscar.

And is this something that you've had before, in the past? OK. OK. Um, fine. OK. So, um, just to really recap, uh, so you're really, in the last couple of weeks, uh, you've been feeling breathless, uh, but worse in the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough. Um, and some swelling in your ankles. Um, reporting no chest pain. Um, and, and have you had any, have you any, have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all? So, palpitations or skipped heartbeat? OK. And any temperatures or fevers? OK. And how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking OK? OK. And your waterworks? Are you passing urine OK? Yeah. Sure, OK. Alright. Um, fine. So, your uh, your past medical history. You mentioned heart failure. Any, any other medical history I should be aware of? OK. OK. And when, when you say a small heart attack, did they give you a name, for what happened, a, a name of a diagnosis? It's more hard to say. OK. Was it like angina or, um, OK. OK. OK. You've been OK since then. OK, alright. So, apart from the uh, the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of? OK. Um, do you take any regular medications, apart from your diuretics that you're taking? And do you know which ones? . Do you know which dose you're taking? That's OK. No problems. Um, Any other medications? OK. The Metoprolol, was it? Or? Sorry, the connection's not very good. OK. Thank you, yeah. And a thousand, OK. Alright. Any allergies at all? Any medications? No. OK. And is there anything in the family that's, uh, that, that's uh, that's important for me to know? Any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems? I'm sorry to hear that. And, um, how old was your father when he passed away? Early sixties, OK. Alright. Anything else I should be aware of? OK. Is your mother still with us? OK, alright. Um, and socially, sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you? You've got two cats. OK, great. Do they have names? OK. Um, so it's just you and your cats. And um, in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment? OK. And how is that? Is that quite stressful, long hours? Mm. Yeah, that's certainly a consideration, isn't it? So let's, let's try and get you better soon, so it doesn't have any um, impact on your, on your job. Uh, and do you find yourself doing a lot of anti-social hours? Do you , do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? OK. OK, alright. And what about smoking and alcohol? So, 'cause that can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you, do you smoke at all? So, you used to smoke? And how many did you smoke a day, on average? Um, and how many, how many years was that for? OK. And what about the stopping? That must have been difficult for you. stopping. Um, and what, what about alcohol? OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir? OK. OK. Right, OK. And certainly now your symptoms, you, you're, you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the uh, to the shop, she said. Um, right. Ohh um, based on your, based on you history, and having listened to your story, I, I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir. Um, Which can sometimes happen. Um, um, and uh, It's . So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. Um, and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously Um, that's the first thing that comes to my mind. Um, now there's a couple of options move forward. Um, Given that you're otherwise well at the moment, and having examined you, your chest, and your saturations and blood pressure are all OK, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Furosemide. Maybe, rather than one tablet a day, we can do two tablets a day, for the first few days. Um, and see, and see how you're getting on. Uh, I think, I think, it's, it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test, and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, to see how well your heart's pumping. Is that something you've had before? Yeah, so um, an , it's a, it's a general scan of your heart. You might have had this done before, when you were diagnosed. And it's just to get a good Sorry? You remember that. OK, fine. That's something I can organize for you today. And, and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But, I think certainly in the meantime, let's, um, Let's, let's get a blood test done. We can check your um, you know your full blood count, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function. Um, and we can definitely increase your um, your Furosemide, uh, to you know, one tablet twice a day. But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, see how you're getting on. That sound reasonable? And of course, in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, feel like you're getting more breathless, or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain, or palpitations or dizziness, then, uh, you know I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well. OK? Do you have any questions for me? Great, and then well I wish you all the best! Have a good day. OK. Thank you.",0.1798732171156893,0.2488372044101034,0.7511627955898965,0.1832122679580306

Can you tell me more about what's been going on? Mm-hmm. Well, let's start with your cough. First, tell me a bit more about your cough. Is it, for example, are you coughing up anything at all or is it mainly dry? So you don't bring up any mucky phlegm. OK. All right. Yeah. OK. So here you got the sniffles. So you've been running bit of a runny nose you mentioned. Yeah, sorry to hear that. You know, it's definitely probably. And any other symptoms, for example, if you had any, any sore throats, any ear pain. OK, who do you support? Right. Yeah, that sounds fascinating to wish them all the best. Moving on the table, so you mentioned a sore throat. If you had a chance to look at in the mirror, have you had a look at the back of your throat? Yeah, no, I mean, have you any, have you noticed any kind of white spots in the back of your back of your throat or redness? No, no, I understand it's not pretty. As I say, it's not, it's not something we we always recommend. But moving on in terms of your ears, any dullness or blocked ears, pain ears. OK. Fine, moving down to your chest, how's your breathing been? So do you feel more breathless or tight in your chest? So your breathing is. Your breathing is fine. Is it you're it's not laboured or? OK, it's not good. OK, OK, so you're, you're feeling more short of breath. OK, OK, OK. Any pain in your chest at all? No thanks. Thank you. OK. Have you noticed yourself any any any temperatures or fevers feeling hot and cold, sweaty? Yeah. Yeah. Seems seems very difficult at the moment. Have you measured your temperature at all? Have you got a? OK. Sure. OK. I'm just moving on just very quickly. Any other symptoms, any nausea, any vomiting, any tummy pain?  OK, and how's your appetite? Are you eating and drinking OK?  Yeah, absolutely, completely recommend that keep keep doing what you're doing. And just lastly, you know any, any kind of muscle pain, joint pains. MMM. Where do you where do you feel the stiffness? All over. OK, And just remind me, when did your symptoms all start, you say? A few days ago. It's Wednesday. OK.  4-5 days, yeah, OK. Are you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off? Is it something you've eaten or have you been travelling recently abroad or? OK. And without prying too much, what were you celebrating? Oh, no. Congratulations. Very nice, very nice. Well, good, excellent. So just moving on regarding what we say past medical history, are you, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? Is there anything to do with your heart, lungs? Diabetes, right? What type of diet is it type one or type 2? OK, OK. It it's time. Yeah, OK. You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure or what is just a wonderful. OK, alright, so moving on in terms of your medications, which medications do you take on a regular basis? That's correct. OK. OK, Mr. Nokia, sounds like. No problems, no problem. That's anything else, Sir. Right. OK. All right. I'm just moving on swiftly. Sir, do you have any allergies at all? Just adding medications really I'm I'm asking not as opposed to other things. OK. And just very briefly socially, Sir, I just want to know, it's very important to ask. You said you live with your wife. Anyone else at home with you? OK, OK, OK. Yep. And are you working at the moment yourself? What did you do?  Really. What about smoking and alcohol, Sir? Do you? Do you either? Roughly on average, how many you drink a week? Well, whatever you drink is a pine beer, lager, wine, spirits. OK, OK. And what about smoking, Sir? OK, OK. Well, I wish, I wish you all the best in your journey to quit. I highly recommend it if you can. It will certainly help your health as well. So just to really just to summarize, I think you know, based on your story, I'm not, I'm not worried. I think you know, what you essentially have is a bit of a bit of a viral illness, perhaps a bit of a maybe signs of a flu. Which I think should settle down really on his own. Over time, things to you know you can do to help yourself, you know stay rested. Drink plenty of fluids if you are. If you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial. You mentioned you're feeling a bit short of breath. I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection. But what we could think about is giving you a a script for antibiotics which you can maybe use in the next 24 to 48 hours if your symptoms don't get better. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll give you a script today. Give it about 24 to 40 hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, 1 tablet, three times a day. And if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me and we can have another look. Exactly. Yes, absolutely. Great. Well, I'm glad I could help and I wish you and your football team all the best. Thank you for all the best. Bye bye. Play.","Hello? Hello? Uh, can you hear me OK? . Great.

day1_consultation07_patient,"Hello. Yes, yeah, I can. I can. Cheers. I am not feeling very well and I haven't been feeling well for a good few days now and I'm really hoping you can do something about it because it's been bugging me for a while now.

So you know, it's a wee bit in the morning, it's a bit worse. But I mean, you know, it's, it's fairly, fairly dry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't like to admit that it's, you know, it's something I would talk about the Yeah, it's so either we the. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Is that, is that coming through loud and clear on the phone? Yeah, the sniffling. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've, I've had a bit of a sore throat. I mean, you know, I'm doing a lot of, you know, watching the watching the football as well. So I do a lot of shouting at that, but I'm not sure if that's related or not. Well, it's a team called Partick Thistle and they're in the, they're not even in the top division of the Scottish League. They're actually in the the Championship, which is the league below that and their bottom of the table. So I've been shouting myself a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been pretty shy, if I'm being honest with you. It's great to be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, I mean, I shave every day, so I'm, I'm looking at myself. It's not, not, not a pretty sight to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been a wee bit, a wee bit rough the last few days for sure. All right, all right. I I, sorry, I mean, I'm looking. No, no, I don't. I don't really like to look, you know, to look at it. So I haven't, I haven't tried to do any of that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, a wee bit. I mean, you know, I'm, I'm 50 years old now. My hearing, you know, it's not as good as it used to be. But, you know, I think, I think it's all right. It's all right. No, no it's not. No, no, no, no. Sorry, what was that? No, it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's not good. It's not good. No, no, no. Yeah, yeah. No, no, it's, it's, it's weird. It's, it's just, you know, it's just a wee bit, it's just a wee bit shortness of breath. But it's not, it's not, it's not pain, you know, as such. Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's definitely something I've noticed like, you know, in in bed with a wife, I'm having to, you know, get out and get the blanket off and put it back on again. It's it's not, it's not pleasant. I mean, I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is bloody nightmare. But I mean, you know how these things are. No, I mean no, I mean, I, you know, I can, I just feel it on my forehead. But I mean, I haven't, haven't, you know, used a thermometer or anything. The, the first, the first day I had, you know, a wee bit of what you know, you know, the like a wee bit of diarrhoea, you know, but that's, that's fine. No. Yeah, but apart from that, no. Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to and I think what, what is it? You, you starve a cold and you feed that. I can't remember what it is, but I think my appetite has been been all right. Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to trying to keep words up as well. You know, here, that's what you should do. Yes. Yeah, it's it's, it's just been AI mean again, you know, I'm I'm getting just a wee bit older now. So it's it's not something that I was thinking about.

Uh, well it's a team, called, Partick Thistle. And they're in the, they're not even in the top division, uh, of the Scottish, league. They're actually in the, the, the championship, which is the league below that, and they're, bottom of the table. So I've been, shouting myself a wee bit hoarse, 'cause their performance has been, uh, pretty shite, if I'm being honest with you. . , yeah, yeah, yeah. , aye, I mean aye, I, I shave, every day so I'm, I'm looking at myself, it's not, not, not a pretty sight to be honest at the best of times but it's been a, wee bit, a wee bit rough, uh, the last few days for sure.

I mean, I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is a, bloody nightmare but, I mean, you know how these things are.

But now you're all the symptoms you're feeling otherwise well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin. I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Have you heard of that condition before? OK, great. Well, I can give you a patient information leave note about that, which gives a bit more information about the disease, but it's something that we can readily treated with a couple of options. We have steroid creams I can give you which will help with inflammation and something called emollients which can help with the dry, dry skin. And that's something you just need to kind of paste on onto your skin. Throughout the day for the next few days and hopefully that helps your symptoms. You can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter. Puritan loratadine that. Can someone help with the itchiness? OK, And that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful.

And so by that I mean, do you have any other medical problems, medical, medical history? Pretty Do you take any regular medications? OK. So you've tried that and then help. OK. All right. Do you have any allergies to any medications? And what happens when you take endomycin? But I guess it's quite, it seems like a quite severe allergy to it, is that right? OK. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of? Relates to kidneys, bladder, bowels, guts. OK. All right. And can we be more about your home situation? Who lives, who's at home with you? OK. And would you? OK. And are you are you working at the moon or are you a student? OK. And what are you studying? And how's that going? Great. Do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers? It was recommended we need doctors. What about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in a way of do you smoke or do you drink much away of alcohol? Socially OK, all right. Right, excellent. So at this stage I'll proceed to examination, but based on your story, just to summarise really it's the last three days you've been having a bit of burning pain on passing urine, a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down. Essentially but but no other fevers or back pain if I understand correctly. I think probably do have what we call a simple UTI or a urinary tract infection. Bladder infection which can be readily treated. So I'll give you a course of antibiotics today, something called either nitrofurantoin or trimethoprin and it's normally a three day course. SO1 tablet twice a day for three days and that should help your symptoms but also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that you know that infection out of your body if you can. You can try cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms. And if you're still not better by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms. OK. Yeah, absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of high temperatures and back pain, just generally feeling more unwell. You know, I do want to give me a call back because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we want to avoid. So do do give me a call if you have any concerns, OK? I mean, if you can try and avoid it, I think that'll be sensible. It's greatly using barrier conception. I would recommend you to continue using barrier conception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up, that'll probably be the best for you and your boyfriend. Great, great. Very much wish you the best.","Hello? Hello? I can hear you, can you hear me? . Excellent, just before I go any further, can you confirm your name and your age, please? OK. And how can I help you Mrs Smith? Right, well , I, thank you for coming in, so hopefully we can help with your symptoms. Um, so you mentioned it started a few days ago.

So, uh, by that I mean, um, any, any diarrhoea, loose stool? OK, all right. And um, Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions, uh, just to , get a full history. Um, hope you don't mind me asking, but are you currently sexually active? OK, is that with a regular, partner? Fine, OK. Um, have you noticed any other discharge from, from down below? No, OK. When was your last um, uh, last STD screen? If, if ever? No, OK, fine. And, and um. Do you use any form of contraception, at all? You use condoms, OK. And when was your last, period? Three weeks ago, OK. Is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps? Is there any chance you could be pregnant? No, no. , it's always worth asking uh, young females like yourself, um. Uh, um, so if that obviously you are worried about the pain. Um, not getting any better, uh, then I'd always , advise getting a pregnancy test, to rule out pregnancy. OK? Um, fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fit and well? And so by that I mean, do you have any other medical problems, medical , medical history? OK. Do you take any regular medications? OK. So you've tried that and it didn't help? OK, all right. Um, do you have any allergies to any medications? And what happens when you take Clindamycin? Right then, OK. So it's quite a, seems like a quite severe allergy to it, is , is that right? Um, OK. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of, um, related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, guts? OK, all right. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's lives, who's at home with you? OK, and what . OK, and are you a, are you working at the moment, or are you a student? OK, and what are you studying? And how's that going? great. Do you have any aspirations for the future, in terms of careers? , recommend it, we need doctors. Um, what about smoking and alcohol?

day1_consultation10_doctor,"Next door. Hello. Can you, can you hear me OK? Right. Excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age please? 19 years old. OK Amanda and how can I help you this afternoon?  Mariah Carey, I'm sorry to hear. There's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. So you mentioned it's been going on for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine, you're going to the toilet more often as well. Is that right? Oh, in the week. Sorry. OK. Have you noticed any anything in your urine? For example any blood or discoloration of urine? All right, OK. Is there any kind of frank blood, I mean red blood at all in your urine? OK, fine. We'll we'll definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you come a bit more about that pain? OK. Can you describe the crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? OK. And does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your side? OK. All right. Any other symptoms at all, for example, nausea, vomiting? Are there any temperatures or fevers? OK. All right. And how are your bowels? Are your bowels working OK? OK. Women say you have problems. What kind of problems do you normally have? Great. There were more than you are the best. OK, all right. But there's no new, no, no, no new symptoms in your bowels. OK, All right. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently, are you currently sexually active? OK. And have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from the front passage? OK. Have you do you use any form of contraception? What kind of pill is it A combined pill or the mini pill? OK, fine. When was the last time you had? Unprotected sex. If you don't mind me asking. Yeah, exactly. Yup. OK. All right. What I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill, but we nonetheless we do have to ask, when was your last? When was your last period? Two weeks ago. OK, All right. Just something to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better, OK? Fine in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment, are you eating and drinking OK? Truth. Sure. Well thanks for sharing with me. So I don't think it is related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just pure coincidence. But you know, I do strongly advise you to, you know, make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forwards, OK? Fine, moving on in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from IBS? Is there anything else I should be aware of? No. OK, great. And will there any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? With that ring with it, Yeah, OK. OK. And the level of the cramps, the crampy pain? Yeah. And do you have any allergies to any medications? OK, OK, OK, OK. Writing. OK, sure. I'll make a note of that. In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No, we don't do anything else good and socially. Tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? Very good. Great, and what are you studying at university? English. OK, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Very good, very good, Good. In terms of smoking and alcohol. Do you do participate in either? OK. What what made you have your first joint last week was that? Hey. Sure. And obviously your doctors are going to look after you. So I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid. Great fine. So this is, I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think, you know, I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple what we say UTI or a cystitis bladder infection. You know, you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain. Would be more worrying for me to hear. So something we we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. So we've got a choice of two antibiotics, something called trimethoprin or nitrofurantoin, which is a three day course normally. They're usually quite effective for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there. Start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. If you are having some pain, simple paracetamol would probably be advisable. We'll see what the urine sample shows and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. But if things are still not getting better next week, come back and see me and we can have another look again. She thought I'd give you a yeah, no, well that's a good question. So I will give you, I will organize for you to come in and drop off a sample of what practices which we can test there and then whether you're in different and also lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. OK, Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, OK? OK. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye.

day1_consultation10_patient,"Hi. Yeah, I can hear you. Sure. I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm 19 years old. So it's been going on for a few days now. It's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. It's quite hurts when I kind of pee and yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more and it's really like I can't like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. And it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well. OK. Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days. I think actually maybe just under a week. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, I it's been going on for about just under a week and yeah, I noticed sort of burning stinging when I, when I go to the toilet, yeah. I think, well, today I noticed that it was like a bit pink the the urine. Yeah, I think just today. I think it was probably, I don't know, it was pink, so. Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, mainly when I go to the loo. I think that's when it's worse. I wouldn't describe it as crampy, I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's hard to say. An achy pain I suppose. No, no. No, I know if I'm saying. No, no, not that I've noticed. I I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different from what it usually is. I think I have IBS. So I just kind of passed my battles like quite quite a lot. And sometimes it's quite, it's quite variable, like sometimes a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, it's sorry, it's a bit disgusting, but like sometimes it's a bit harder and it's kind of hard to predict. Like. No, no, not going to play. Yeah, I have a long term boyfriend. Not no, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Yeah, I'm on the pill. Combined pill. I mean, I mean unprotected, there's like no, no condoms or anything. I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend, just like, I don't know, we've just kind of agreed. So I guess a week ago, two weeks ago, quite recently. Two weeks ago. N. Yeah, yeah. Eating, drinking. OK. I did have one kind of concern. I don't know. So I smoked. This is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago. I just wonder whether it's related at all. Probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. So. OK. No, no. Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M It's pretty hard to pronounce. Like maybe something. Maybe. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think there's an antibiotic called Clindus Clindamycin missing that I took like a couple years ago or something. And yeah, that that didn't go too well. With me. No, no. So I am living in halls at the moment, uni, so I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose. But my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away. So yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Yeah. Things I think, I think generally. I'm studying English. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago. And yeah, I really enjoyed it. Yeah, yeah, it's really fun. As I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally, kind of socially with friends. I I was just a party. There were other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy, probably wasn't thinking quite straight, but yeah, I completely agree it's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. OK, OK.  OK. Yep. OK. OK, OK, great. With with the urine sample and how do I go about doing that? Do you know, is it through the app? OK. OK, perfect. Great. Either Backbone. Yeah, I'll chat with this. OK, great.

And it's really, like I can't, like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. Um, and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm, like in at the bottom of my tummy as well. Uh, yeah it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days I think actually, maybe just under a week. Um. Sorry no I didn't explain it properly before, um yeah no I it's been going on for about just under a week. Um, and yeah I notice a sort of burning, stinging, when I when I go to the toilet, yeah. Um, I think, well today I noticed, um, that it was like a bit pink. The, the urine. Yeah, I think just today . Um, I think it was probably but I don't know it was pink so. Yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, um, uh mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. Um, I wouldn't describe it as crampy I don't think it's like a period pain, it's a bit different, it's, it's hard to say, an achey pain I suppose. No, no, no. No, no nausea vomiting. Um no, no not that I've noticed. Uh I, I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any, different, from what it usually is. Um, I think I have, um, IBS, um, so I just kinda pass, uh, my bowels like quite, quite a lot. Um, and sometimes it's quite, it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry if it's a bit disgusting but like, sometimes it's a bit uh harder and kind of hard to predict. Like, yeah OK. No, no, not Uh uh yeah um, I have a, a long-term, um, boyfriend. Hmm no I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Uh yeah, uh I'm um on the pill. Uh, combined pill. Um, uh, I mean, mean unprotected as in like no, no condoms or anything? Um, I, I guess 'cause, um, I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend, like. I dunno we've just kind of agreed, uh, so um I guess, a week ago, two weeks ago , quite quite . Um, two weeks ago. Uh, yeah, yeah eating drinking OK. Um, I did have one kinda concern I dunno So I I smoked, uh this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time. Uh, like a week and a half ago, I I just wondered whether it's related at all, probably not but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure OK. Sure. OK. Sure . No, nope. Apart from the pill, um, I take, um, something for the IBS as well. Um it begins with an M, it's pretty hard to pronounce like something , maybe. Yeah, yeah that's it. Yeah, yeah that's right. Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah I think there was an antibiotic, um, called Clindamycin mycin . Then I took like something and yeah that, that didn't, go too well, with me. No, no. Um, so I am living in halls at the moment, uh at uni um, so uh, uh, I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose, um. But my family, uh, live kind of outside of London not too far away. Um, so yeah the my family are fine and I see them now and then. Uh, yeah things I think, I think they're OK generally. I'm studying, uh, English. Yeah, yeah it's it's going well thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago and yeah I, I really enjoy it. Yeah, yeah it's really fun. Uh, as I admitted before I tried weed for the first time, uh, but, uh, I don't smoke. Uh ,I drink occasionally, um, kind of socially, um, with friends . Um, I it was just a party,.Um, there were other people doing it, um. I kind of was a little bit tipsy so, probably wasn't thinking quite straight. Um, but yeah I, I completely agree it's not something I wanna get into on a regular basis. Sure. OK. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. OK. Yeah. OK. OK, OK uh great. Um, with, with the urine sample, um, uh, how do I go about doing that, do you know? Is it through the app? OK. OK perfect. Great. Either back pain, vomiting, great OK. Yeah, I'll watch out for those.

day1_consultation11_doctor,"Hello. Hello. Can you hear me OK? That's perfect. No. It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine. Now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? 27 OK. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan?   Wow, no sorry to hear that. Seems like there's a lot going on there. Well when did it all start your symptoms? OK. And is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools, How many times are you going a day, would you say? All right, well. You're losing a lot of fluid there. OK, have you got any blood in your stools? OK. And any, any tummy pain any, any, any pain in your tummy? With. And where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? Well, why don't we start with? Is it? Is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? OK. And this is pain come and go or is there constantly? Fine, OK. And if I was asking to get a one to 1010 being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Is it is this pain that's making you double over? Is it 10? Is it 10 out of 10, the worst pain you've ever had? Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a three out of 10? OK, All right, good. Part of the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting.  Not easy. OK, always. The vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea, is that right? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea, is that right? OK, OK. All right. Any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? OK. OK. So you've been in horse, OK. In terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine, OK. OK, All right, fine. And you said, you mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you for example gone out, had some take away food, Have you been around anyone else and with diarrhea, for example?  Your elder brother now better. OK. All right. Are you having anything to eat or drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? OK, All right, fine. When was the last time we had anything solid to eat which kept which, which you kept in? All right. And Dan, moving forward, are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history?  I'll take it you don't take any regular medications then? OK. And do you have any allergies, any medications? OK. What about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? Yeah, yeah. So what I mean by that is a whole gut really anything from the. Oh dear, I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he?  Yeah, OK. Oh. Well, as I'm really sorry, I'll make a note though, because it's important to know these kind of details and socially. Tell me more about your home frustration. Who's at home with you, Dan? And how are things at home? Using general day-to-day life, are you managing OK? Any particular speakers?   Sure what what you mentioned? Were you mentioned work? What is it you do for work? Cover it. OK. So OK, right. There's a couple of last final couple, a couple of questions there, smoking and alcohol. Do you do either do you smoke or do you drink much in way of alcohol? And the alcohol. But not. MMM. Well, thank you for sharing me. That's very helpful to know. So Dan, just as a conclusion, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis, bit of a basic infection of your tummy, of your gut. There's nothing to worry about. I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days. Just like it did for your brother, Drink. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids, OK? You can. Well, Leah, fluid is probably best, but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins so you can get things like diolite, which is a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth recommending that. No, you can just get that over the counter. You can try just, you know, regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish but if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days. So 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because you know, if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, OK. But I think let's let's see how you are the next one to two days and we'll catch up soon, OK? Food dissolve. Yeah, absolutely. It's a clear flows. You can use soft diet things like soup, mash and then gradually build up as much as your body can tolerate. But really, let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first, OK? Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think paracetamol is very sensible. I'm going to try and avoid alcohol if you can. OK. All right then. Thank you for your help. No worries. Thank you. Bye. Bye now.","Hello? Hello? Can you hear me OK? That's perfect. Um this audio. And then it's absolutely fine.

day1_consultation11_patient,"Hello. Hello. I can hear you, but I can't really see you. Is that OK? Am I meant to just connection on the screen? OK. So my name is Dan Chaudhary. I am 7/27. So I've just been having some troubles basically in, I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great. And it's all come from like it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery. And yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's just, it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's yeah, it's just not not being very pleasant. And like I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better so. So I think it was a few when I think about it. So Monday, Tuesday I saw, I think it was about 3. It's been about 3 days now. So I I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Sorry. Yeah, so I mean, I'm, I'm trying to drink a lot of water, but yeah, it's just quite a lot. And it's yeah, I think I feel like it's just just fluids coming out. So I, no, I don't, I don't remember anything like, no, I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing like that. Yeah, I mean, I, I feel, I feel a cramp and then and then I know it's time to go, right. So around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah, I mean, that's that's the kind of first sign. It's kind of as I want to. If I think about it, it's like it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. I I think if it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side. Left to right. It it comes and goes, it comes and goes. OK, so like. So what do you mean by? Pain. So I I think it's maybe. A. I, I guess so I'm, when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it so I can still sit down and I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice. So I, I don't know what that means, but maybe is that like a six or A7? OK. Yeah, I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous like and like I've have vomited. And when I like I think it's maybe something to do with like whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like, yeah, one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. I've been, I've been trying to avoid it, but yeah. Umm, sorry, could you repeat that? No, no it's not. So I, yeah, I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's yeah, I've, I've not like not a normal temperature. Yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe, but it seems to be OK. So I know, so my my brother has had actually had something like this for he has it as well for five days as well. And I, I, I'm not, yeah, I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me. But yeah, that's why. He so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure, he said. He said he had he's had something for a little while as well. So it just feels like the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. Just feels like it's going straight through. So I had some, I mean, I had some lunch today. But again, it just, it just came come out pretty loose. So I, yeah, I think, I think otherwise fitting well. I, yeah, I mean, I, I'm an OK way and I, I can't think of any related medical history. I mean like my yeah, No, I don't think so. So I. No, I mean I I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately, but I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. So I don't have any allergies that I know of. So would Val like this? Is the colon like something that? So my yeah, my, my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment. So from what I heard, he's kind of so I don't, I don't speak to him that often. So I don't, I don't know the exact details and I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing. But he's. Sort of in his third stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly. And yeah. So yeah, it's it's. He's yeah, you can. I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot. And that's it's quite, I guess it's had it proved a little while now. So not my brother, he doesn't live with me. I'm I live with my sister and my mum. I think in what sense do you mean that? I mean, I think, yeah, it's been, it's been tricky going to work with all of this. Umm, I dislike, umm, taking time off work. I feel like I, I just want to go when I can, so I, I try and go, I think at home. Yeah. I just haven't really. I don't normally actually. Eat with my family, I normally I'm buying stuff and that kind of thing, so I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been, I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it. Yeah, I'd just rather deal with these things. Umm, so. Yeah. So I work at, I work at an office in central London. It's so I work in government. So I I smoke, I smoke. For like socially but not like regularly. So normally if it's a Friday or something like that, I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that, but not really. Sorry. So alcohol. You know, I might have a beer during the weekdays, maybe not that many, maybe want to see on Fridays I have more alcohol. Umm, but yeah, uh, IA lot more units. Umm, I suppose. Umm, not every week, but maybe. Once or twice a month that yeah, I'll go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot. So that, that's, yeah. OK. OK. Uh-huh. Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink it's just coming out. Send it. Do I need like a prescription for that? OK. OK. OK, so you're saying that I should, I could, I'll try and buy this directly. What, what should I do in terms of food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids? OK. Is it OK for me to carry on having like paracetamol and things like that? OK. Uh, OK, I'll try, yeah. OK. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks for helping me out. OK, but.","Hello? Hello. Uh I can hear you, but I can't really see you. Is, is that OK?

day1_consultation13_doctor,"There's no delays. Hello. Hello there, thanks for thanks for being here. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age please? OK, Adriana, how can I help you this afternoon? Oh dear. OK, when? When did they exactly start? Just headache. Three days ago. OK, And whereabouts in your head is this pain? Oh OK, And is a headache there all the time or does it come and go? OK, So it comes in fine. OK. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to 1010 being the worst type of pain you've ever had, how would you rate this headache? Great. And if I was to ask you to describe the headache to me in terms of the nature of the pain, is it sharp? Is it dull? Is it crampy? Is it throbbing? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days? OK, have you tried anything which made a headache better? Help. OK, no worries except the headaches. Any other symptoms at all? So for example, any problems with your eyesight or your vision? It wouldn't say annoying because it had to look look at bright lights. OK. And have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? MMM. OK, any nausea or any vomiting? When you say sick, you mean you feel sick? OK, Yeah. No vomiting. OK Any neck pain or neck stiffness? OK. Any difficulty with speaking or? Speech. Any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs? Oh, really? OK, OK, no problem. Well, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Any recent head injuries at all? OK. And have you had anything like this before in the past? Or similar to similar to this kind of headache. There's not. OK. All right. Any temperatures or fevers? Any rashes at all on your skin? OK. And just moving forward, are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana? You fitting well. Do you have any other medical history? Any history of migraines at all? OK. Fine. I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication? Are you on the pill? OK. Do you have any allergies to any medications? OK, so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines. Are they is that normally well controlled or are they having difficulty controlling their symptoms? Mm-hmm. OK. All right. Socially, tell me a bit more about your life outside of. Outside of work? So who lives at home with you? Thank you. Excellent. And are you working at the moment you mentioned this impact on your work? OK. Do you wear glasses? Have any? Have you had any recent eye check done? Eye test? OK, all right, something free to bear in mind. If you know your eyes are straining, I will always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Have you been more stressed or anxious at work recently? OK, alright, great. Regarding smoking or alcohol, do you drink or smoke at all? So only socially OK. Right now, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you have you read anything online or spoken to people?  MMM. OK. Is there anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? OK. How many tablets did you take of ibuprofen? 3A day. OK, All right. So Adriana, so really what I think is going on here, unfortunately, I do think this could be a headache very similar to migraine. The reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it. Given your mum and your sister also migraines, I think it's something for us to think about. Now I'm not saying it's going to keep happening, but it may just be a one off, but it's certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesic. Now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. You tried the ibuprofen. Now my only worry is I'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets three times a day. So there's definitely room for improvement there. Or I can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory, which can be helpful. We can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol. Or codeine which might be helpful as well. OK. I think it's it's only worth looking into so I can give you a prescription for that today. With regards to the. The next few days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's you know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. And you know, I'd like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, week to two weeks time if you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches. We can think about giving you medications as prophylactic, which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis, but we can have that discussion next time. OK, in the meantime, if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse, you know, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner, OK? So if you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you're just not feeling very well, just give me a call and come back and see me, all right? Great. Well, have a good day. Right.","There's no . , hello? Hello there. Um, thanks for, thanks for, being here. Um, before I go any further, can I uh, confirm your name and your age please?

And you're not bringing up any mucky phlegm or anything like that? No. OK, so keeps you up at night. You mentioned the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose. Do you have a sore throat at all? Right. Do you have any? How are your ears? Your ears feel blocked. No pain or discharge committee is. OK. All right. Fine, in terms of your breathing, how's your breathing? How's your chest? Is your breathing more laboured? I. The day today when you walk around, you don't feel breathless, do you? Right. Any pain in your chest? OK, you mentioned feeling tired. Have you felt feverish at all? Have you had a temperature? OK. MMM MMM. My dear. OK, OK. All right. Fine. In terms of any other symptoms. Have you had any nausea? Have you had any vomiting? How's your appetite? Thank. OK, has that got better now the diarrhea. OK, fine. Any problems with your waterworks at all? Are you your waterworks? Your urine? You're passing urine, OK? You're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine, OK. OK. All right. In terms of any other thing you notice any any funny skin rashes or problems with your muscles or joints? Yeah. OK. Right. Right. OK, OK. I'm sorry. That must be very difficult for you. Would drink quite lethargic and weak mentioned. OK. And April, are you normally otherwise fit and well? Fitting well. So do you have any other medical history? OK. OK. And what do you take for your blood pressure, any or what medications you take on a regular basis? Yup. OK, fine. Any allergies at all to medications? No. OK. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of? There you go. Alright, who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone? Do you have a doctor in hospital diabetes? Great, Excellent. In terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you? Liz OK, fine. Is your partner well at the moment? Right, OK. Oh, wait, he's got away with it at the moment. OK. And are you working at the moment, April? Yeah. MMM. No, I can imagine what is it that you do for work. So you work in the IT field OK. Right, OK. No. Has it been quite stressful recently? The reason I sometimes. Some reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. But it's good to know you're you're, you're not feeling stressed. Do you smoke at all, April? OK, and what about alcohol? And what is it that you drink? And what how much do you drink on those nights? OK, so. Yeah. So you're probably just about under the limit of. The recommended limit, something we think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can. Really, ideally the right answer is to cut down completely, but. Practice. I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks 1 you can't enter 2 glasses a week and then one week thereafter. And if you are coping OK, then we can maybe try and cut down altogether. OK. Just something for you to think about. Right. So just as we wrap up really April, I think based on your story, I think essentially, I think you're going through a bit of, a bit of a viral illness. I don't think there's anything to worry about. You know, you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic. I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been 5 days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better. The next couple of days normally last about a week to 10 days. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know, get some nice good rest, drink plenty of fluids, keep yourself well hydrated. You can take the regular paracetamol. If you feel like it's still looking better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over. And if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest, which can sometimes be a common source of infection. Yeah. So I think, you know, really I think it depends on you. It's if you are coughing, then there is a theatrical, you know, risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can get some good bed rest and maybe think about work early next week. But if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner, OK? No, no, nothing to worry about otherwise. OK, great. Have a good day.

I've been having like like shivers even when I'm in when I'm in bed. You know, like when you, when you go to sleep and, and you feel like I, I should be warm, but I'm still still, you know, shivering a little bit. But I haven't taken my temperature. So I'm not 100% sure if I had a fever, but it feels like I probably did because I was just, I was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine. And I just like couldn't stop shivering and kept adding more sweaters on and I was still cold. No, no, no, not yet. No vomiting. Like, yeah, nothing like that. I mean, it's OK. I at the beginning, like when I was starting to have this, listen to the coughing and stuff, I had a little bit of diarrhea, but but I didn't, it didn't cut my appetite or anything. I just like my stomach wasn't feeling great. Yeah, yeah, it got better. It was only like the first, like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped. So I thought everything would be fine. But then the costs just going. With my what? Oh, no, no, no, that's fine. No, I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhea. Now that it stopped I just went back to normal. Like my, you know when I have to, when I was telling you I had like the I had chills and I was really cold. My mom was really hurting. Pilates like it's hurting me so much at the moment. But to be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed. Especially like in my arms, my leg, like just everywhere basically. Yeah. Pretty much. Am I normally what? Well, I have type 2 diabetes. Quite high blood pressure. I take metformin for the diabetes and I take lisinopril for the high blood pressure. No, Jeez. My dad also has type 2 diabetes but I think that's it. I just regularly go see a doctor and just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I I have it under control and since I've started taking this medication I've just been like regularly checking that it's it's under control. Just it's just me and my partner. Yeah, he has none of this. Like he's just going ahead like, like nothing, nothing like. I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him, but. Not Diary of Nothing, he's fine.

I've been going in but it's not been fun. I am a developer. Yeah, where can I? OK, not too active a job. No more than usual.

I used to but I've stopped for about 6 months now. I mean, yeah, I don't think I drink that much. I I don't really know how you count the units, but I guess like I don't drink more than like like say 3 evenings a week and I rarely get like properly drunk or anything. Wine, mostly.

day2_consultation01_doctor,"Hi there. Good morning. I'm Doctor Dean Meza from Babylon. Can you hear me OK? Yeah, OK, great. Well, nice to see you this morning. Before we start your appointment, can I confirm your full name and date of birth, please? That's perfect. Thank you. Jack, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment? OK, great. So tell me what's been going on. You've been saying there's a problem with your hearing. Is that right? Right. OK. How long has this been going on for? Six weeks, OK. And before that, have you had any hearing problem at all? Right, OK. OK. And in this six week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all? Right. OK. And just to clarify, the difficulty you've got in hearing, is that both ears or just the left ear? All right, so your right ear is fine. OK. So you've had ringing, difficulty hearing in your left ear and feeling slightly sick and that's been on and off for the six weeks or is it continuous throughout that six weeks? Right. And have you had any pain from the ear at all? OK. Any discharge coming out of the ear? No. OK. Have you have you been experiencing any fever? Right, OK, and has your ear been itchy at all? OK now do you use cotton or buds to try and clean out wax from your ears? No, OK, well, you're right. You shouldn't be, shouldn't be doing that. It doesn't clean up the wax and pushes it back in. All right, The first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear. OK. And just exclude the simple things. Simple things might be wax, you know someone might have impacted wax blocking the tube going into the ear drum, which can lead to muscle hearing. If that's the case that that's something that's easily fixable. But so we need to exclude that first and then after that we can consider other potential possibilities. And for that we need to have a look inside the eardrum. So what I think we could do is. Maybe if we book you in for a face to face appointment in one of our clinics. It's not an emergency. It can be done within the next four or five days or so. OK. And then what I'll do is I'll send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to slot you into in a clinic, one of our clinics in that time frame. You can come in and one of the GPS just have a quick look down the ear and figure out whether there's a physical blockage or whether there's something else going on. OK, Can I just double check the dizziness that you've been getting, How severe is it? Yeah. Right, right. OK. Have you have you any chest pain with it, any palpitations, heartbeat and fast? OK, fine. All right, So let's get your ear checked out. I think that would be the most sensible thing to do. And then after that we can, we'll be accepted to figure out which way we're going to go. It might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear, but we just need to exclude whether there's a physical blockage first and try and deal with that if that's the case, OK. What you know the ringing that you've got, that you've got something called tinnitus, OK. And tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors, we don't really understand it fully. We haven't you know, people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get tinters and some patients don't. It can be triggered by a wide range of different things. And in fact, I'm glad that you've mentioned that what I might do in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I'm going to put paste the link for a leaflet about. In the notes for this appointment, I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it. OK. And often that that awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are and there are limited options that helps us in terms of the conversation about what we do next, if you're it is clear. OK, so I'm going to paste a link to that and you can read about that. And what we'll do is we'll see you in about four or five days time. It won't be with me, it'll be another GP, but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what what my question is, which is just to check your ears. Is that OK? All right, great. So bear with me. 5 minutes and then you come in the support team. I'll leave the number in the notes of this appointment, ring them and then they'll stop you in, OK? All right, if any, if there's any problem any issues between now and when the clinic appointment is just book another appointment. You can speak to one of our server video. OK. All right, then take a nice to see you this morning. OK, bye bye.","Hi, there. Good morning! Uh, I'm Dr. Dean Mesa from Babylon. Can you hear me OK? Yeah, OK, great.

day2_consultation02_doctor,"Hi there. Good morning. I'm Doctor Dean Mesa from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. OK, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? OK, That's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're OK to speak freely? OK, great. OK, So tell me a bit about what's been happening. You said, you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Sure. Sure, sure. And so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow? Left upper OK. And have you banged that elbow? Did you have any kind of injury? Sure. OK. And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Right. OK. And has this happened before? So, OK, and can I, can I just double check, has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? OK, sure. So you know, you said you think you've got osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a Doctor Who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis? OK. Was that AGP or a specialist or is it a physiotherapist? GP OK, All right. Can I just sorry, can I just double check how old you are please? 53 OK, fantastic. All right. And do you have any other illnesses at all? Right, OK. OK. Are you allergic to any medication? Yeah, sure. And do you, are you on any medication on a regular basis? No. OK. And you normally fit in well mobile? OK, good. Glad to hear that. Well done. That's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. OK. And. Can I Is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now? OK, bear with me one second. Right, OK. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so I can just see the underside. OK, fantastic. All right And then just bring it round to this side essentially I can see the other side. OK, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers does is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin that adjacent skin? It's a bit warmer, OK. And is it very tender when you're pressing on that? Now if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all? OK, All right. What I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the. Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? Do you suffer from eczema at all? No, all right. OK, So what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, OK, is I think it would be worthwhile. This seems like what we call the Bursitis. OK, so that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication. In the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling, OK. So what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done and that will involve you. Having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers. Infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well, OK. The time frame for that will be the results will come back to us after about 5-6 days from now. We take time for the forms to come out to you. And if you get the forms that test done straight away, by the time that we're expecting a result back, you know, one or two days after that we're looking at maybe 6 days. And what I'd suggest is. We can arrange a follow up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests and we can get the gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint. Right now it doesn't look like to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that someone might have been acutely infected joint. And your your joint doesn't look like that. However, if your the elbow was to become very red, very painful, and the redness was to spread or become, you know, more intense, then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment, OK. No, I don't think this is anything dangerous. I don't need to worry, OK? What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop. OK, So if things were to work, then this, this is not the case right now. Right now it looks quite straightforward. It's nothing sinister or life threatening. What I'm doing is I'm just saying in case things worsen, these are the things that we'll be looking out for. And this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now thankfully. And I don't think you're going to have it, but I'm just saying the what if scenario. Is that OK? All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? OK. All right. OK. So I would take ibuprofen regularly. OK, you can get that over the counter. That's 400 milligrams two times a day and you should take that after food, not an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. OK, All right, So what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you and we are going to arrange a follow up appointment maybe within actually, you know, the following doesn't have to be face to face. If it's more convenient to do to do it over the phone, we can do that. Over the phone, over video, we can do that. That's your call. But you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then, OK. Sure, sure. That's good idea. Alright then. OK, take care then. So just leave that with me. I'll sort all those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll we'll review you after the test. Things go well. OK. All right then. Take care. All the best. Bye.

day2_consultation04_doctor,"Hi there. Good morning. I'm Doctor Dean, Missouri from GP at hand. Nice to see you. OK so before we start your appointment can I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Just tell me how old you are. 45 OK could you just confirm the first line of your address and your post code? That's great. OK. Thank you. Are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment? OK, fantastic. All right, So tell me what's been going on. You said you're a bit short of breath. Is that right? Right, OK, OK. And how long has this been going on for now? Right. OK. Any other symptoms at the same time you've had this pain? Right. OK, OK, All right. We might, it might all be connected then and yesterday before this, all of this will be completely fine. OK, so you can feel your heart kind of beating a bit faster? You think the normal is that? Sure. OK. All right. And how long has that been for the tiredness and not wanting to exercise? Couple of weeks, OK. And then and the last day or so, that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side and you've coughed blood. OK. All right. You said you felt a bit warmer. Have you measured your temperature at all? Enough. All right, OK. And now can I just ask, do you smoke at all? What do you work as? OK, all right. And do you live alone? Yeah, in a flat or a house. OK. Do you have any pets? A cat, OK. Are you on any medication at all? Regular medication? Methotrexate. OK, what are you on that for? SLE OK. Do you have any other diagnosis? Any other illnesses at all? Right. OK. And do you have any allergies to any medication, any other allergies at all? OK, So you're on, you're taking methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had methotrexate? You had this morning. OK. All right, All right. OK. Couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and get an idea of how unwell you are. OK. The first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse. So the way we're going to do this is that if you're, if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist. Not everyone can do this, so don't worry. You can't. But if you if you can tell me whether you can fill the regular deposit. It's just under the thumb. You can put your fingers up and down like that. You might be able to feel the pulse. You've got it. OK. You sure? All right, So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting. OK. So I'll just get my stopwatch up. OK. So if you can, you've still got the pulse, OK, So if you can start counting now, please. If you can stop now, I think that was about 11 or 12. So that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74. That's that's OK. Good, fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do OK, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible. But next I'd like to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back. OK, So if you can see what I'm doing now, my fingers come right behind the screen. I'm squeezing it. OK, just walk through. So this is what should be first. Yeah, I'm, I'm squeezing it and then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour. OK, So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the your camera and then with the other hand just try and squeeze it and. OK, perfect. That's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to try and have a look down your throat. OK. Are you doing this consultation via a phone or a laptop? A phone. So say that again. OK, so if you if you position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide and let me see if I can have it, That's fantastic and say ah. Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. OK, last thing is if I can get you to feel inside your neck, just on the sides here, OK, by your Adam's apple, tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not. OK. All right. Now. Sorry, I've forgotten your name. Doris. Doris. So Doris. What what I think we need to do is this sounds like you might have a chest infection, OK, if you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing. I think you need to be examined today. Someone need to listen to your chest and maybe check your blood pressure as well. Check that you're stable. I have to say examining you now from what limited examination I could do online, your everything does seem to be OK in terms of you don't seem acutely unstable however. If you've got this kind of pain when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a pneumonia or chest infection, and that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope and you may need an antibiotic. This is one thing I need to ask you. Have you been on any long haul flight recently? No. OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your lung? Blood clots. No. OK. Anyone in the family have that? No. OK. All right. What I think we'll do is we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today, OK. I would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters, OK. You may well need an antibiotic. OK. Do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No. OK. I'm not. I'm going to not. I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because I think you need to have that basic assessment first. Before we proceed to the next step, but that's what I would predict the next step might be. I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team and then they will book you in for a face to face appointment with one of our GPS today and they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there, OK. Given the the way in which you have presented now just one day with a fever and this slight pain concurrent with the blood that their phlegm. That's not usually how lung cancer is present. There's more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms. However, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding in the CU. All right. Are you worried about lung cancer? So of course, yeah. So just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry, 45. OK? It's something we do need to be cognizant of, OK? And we may end up having to do a follow up chest X-ray if things don't settle down, but at the moment it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer. Yeah, that is good to know. Yes, because that's easier to treat, but we still need to make sure that things are OK because chest infections can become nasty as well. It can lead to infection inside the body. We want to avoid that as well. So let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment. All right, you're welcome. All right. Take care then. All the best. Bye.","Hi there. Good morning. Um, I'm Doctor Deen Mirza from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. OK. So, before we start your appointment.

And then you can see, that, it goes, pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour, OK. So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the, your camera. And then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it, and see. OK, perfect, that's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do, is I'd like , to , try and have a look down your throat. OK. Are, are you doing this consultation via, um, a phone or a , laptop? A phone? , sorry, say that again. OK, , OK. So if you, if you, um, position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have a . That's, fantastic. And say ah. Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. OK. Last thing, is if I can get you to feel inside your neck. Just on the sides here, OK, um, by your Adam's apple. Tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not. . OK. All right. Um. Now, um, uh, . Sorry, I've forgotten your name. Doris, OK Doris. Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do, is um. This sounds like you might have a chest infection. OK. If you're coughing up blood, and you're feeling your heart racing. Um. Uh, I think, you need to be examined today, someone needs to listen to your chest. And, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well, check that, you're stable. I have to say examining you now, from what limited, examination I could do online. You're, everything does seem to be OK, in terms of, you, you don't seem acutely unstable. However, if you've got, this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood. We do, do, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a Pneumonia or chest infection. And um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um, an antibiotic. Uh, there's one thing I need to ask you. Have you been, on any long-haul flight recently? No, OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs, or clots in your lung? Blood clots? No, OK. Anyone in the family have that? No, OK. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today. OK. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest, and check your blood pressure. And to, to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure, and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters are OK. You may well need an antibiotic, OK. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No, OK. Um, I, I'm not, I'm gonna, not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now, because I think you need to have that, basic assessment first. Um, before we proceed to the next step. But the, that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment, for you to ring our support team. And then, they will, book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today. And then, they'll do that assessment, and then we'll take it from there, OK. Um, uh, given the, the way in which you uh, have presented now. Just one day, with a fever and, this slight pain, , concurrent with the, the blood in the, the, the flem. That's not usually how lung cancer is presented. It's more insidious, over a longer period of time, with other symptoms. Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding, when we see you. All right. , are you worried about lung cancer? . Sure, of course yeah. So, just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry. Forty five, OK. It's something we do need to be cognisant of, OK. Um, and, we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray, if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it, it seems more like a chest infection, rather than a lung cancer. Yeah, that, that is good to know, yeah, so that's, 'cause that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are OK because, chest infections can become nasty as well. It can lead to infection inside the body, , we want to avoid that as well. So, let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest, and get you on the right course of treatment. All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye.",0.1088216355441081,0.1415046222219832,0.8584953777780168,0.1095268956578094

day2_consultation05_doctor,"Hi there. Good morning. I'm Doctor Dean Miller from UK. Nice to see you. OK, so before we start your appointment could I confirm your full name and date of birth please? Sorry I didn't catch your date of birth. 32 years old. OK, could you tell me the first line of your address and your post code please? That's great. Thank you so much for that. Are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment? OK, so how can I help you today? What are some problems with the afternoon? Is that right? How can I help you today? OK. OK. So tell me a bit more about these weeds, something we've been having. Right. So just the connection is not so great. You've been getting pins and needles in the hand, is that right? OK. Is that the right or left hand? Is it always the right? OK, we've lost video now. Maybe is there a button you can press? OK. Are you happy for us to carry on without the video? I can't see you at the moment. All right, so you've been having these pins and needles, episodes of numbness in the right hand. Is it just the hand or does it go up the arm as well? Right. OK. And is there any involvement of your leg at all? OK, you said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month. So what has been happening from the beginning of the month? What else has been happening? Right, OK. And. You know, your colleague said you've, you've not been walking normally. Do you feel anything different on either side in terms of your legs? Have you noticed anything different? Right. OK. And you know you the abnormal gate, has that been present outside of these episodes? Right. All right, OK. And. These these episodes, how often have they been happening? Right. OK. And how long have these episodes been going on for? When, when did it all start? Right. OK, OK. And along with these symptoms of the weakness and numbness. Do you have any other symptoms at the same time, like swallowing or difficulty speaking or vision problems? Right. Is that during these episodes or outside of these episodes? OK, do you have any difficulty swallowing at all? During the episodes, do you have any difficulty swallowing? OK, what about difficulty speaking during these episodes? Any any issues with that at all? OK any visual problems during these episodes? OK. All right. Now can I just ask has is there any history of or many strokes in your family? Right, OK. And how about yourself? Have you had any history of? Mini strokes or anything like that along those lines. I know you're quite young. Good. Excellent. So you had a blood test done and did they check with diabetes as well? Fantastic. OK, Now do you have any other illnesses at all? No. Are you on any medication? OK. So. So why is that? Why did you take that? OK, have you ever told a doctor before your GP that you're on aspirin? OK. And has any GP ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin and whether you should be on it or have you not told the GP in the past? Yeah. OK. All right. Now in terms of your, your kind of social situation, are you working at the moment? What do you work as? You're a medical doctor, OK, Which specialty are you in? That's it. Surgery. OK, great. And do you have any allergies to any medication at all? OK, and are you living alone? One. OK, fantastic. Do you smoke at all? Right. OK, that's fine. Now obviously you're you're a medic yourself. Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on? Right, OK. Well, the way you're describing these episodes, they make me concerned about mini strokes or TI as transient ischemic attacks. And so that's something quite urgent and given that you've got a family history of stroke. Even though you're quite young, I think it's something that we need to exclude. So what I'm probably going to do, in fact, what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer you to a stroke at CIA clinic. Now just to double check, do you have the symptoms right now? OK. So, So what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer you to a mini stroke clinic or ATIA clinic. I send that referral off now and then you can attend them. They'll usually call you in within the next one to two days, OK, Because it's something relatively urgent. Now today it's Wednesday, so we've got a few days before the weekend. So basically the deadline should be Thursday, Friday, we're expecting to be seen by that time. That's the kind of turn around we're looking at and in that clinic. They'll be doing a number of things. They'll be checking, they'll be doing the ultrasound of the carotid artery like your father had, and they'll be doing maybe they might do a scan of the brain as well to show that there's signs of a bleed there. But they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame in order to exclude whether you have any illness, got any kind of stroke or mini stroke. Now if your symptoms return and they persist, they're prolonged then. You may need to attend the A&E OK because. Are presumptive working diagnosis is mini stroke or Tia. OK. And if a mini stroke is prolonged, then then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke. And in that case, that becomes even more of an emergency. So we're not talking about waiting one or two days. We want you to go to hospital in that instance as soon as possible. OK. Now if things happen again, feel free to contact us. We can assess you over the phone. We can give you direction and guidance over the phone. That's that's that's not a problem. You know, you've got easy access to us. OK, so this is the plan going forward. I'm going to do that referral. You should hear back from the hospital relatively soon. The hospital, you could actually ring them on the PALS number. And then there's also a clinic number. I'm going to do that number in the notes for this complication. OK, so you'll have all the information you need to chase this appointment. And if you want, you can ring them either today or tomorrow morning. Today in the afternoon, wait one or two hours. Or tomorrow morning just to find out when they're planning to slot you in and just to make sure they've got you in the system that they've got them in books and they're going to be calling you in, OK? So this isn't an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to any, but it's something quite urgent that we need to deal with in a short space-time, OK? So if there's if there's any delay that transpires, for example, you can't make the appointment or you know that you don't get called something you get in contact back with us, OK. All right. Did you have any questions at all? OK, great. So just bear with me a few minutes and then I'll send that all through and then you should, you should be able to have you should have the information at your hands in order to get into further, OK.

Did you say it was your arm? All right. And you've got a rash there. Can I have a look? OK, all right, that looks OK to me right now. Read to you at the moment. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The puncture mark. Yeah. OK. All right. Now is is there any swelling around that area that you can see? I couldn't see any. Sure. OK. All right. Now, have you taken any medication? It's probably, you probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago, but have you, is it not taking any antihistamines or anything like that? OK. Now if I can just go back, do you have any history of any, any kind of illnesses at all? OK. Thank you. OK. Have you got a history of any allergies to anything? All right, good. And in your family, is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute reaction? Right. And do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that? Yeah, and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware. OK. Can I ask, do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that? Right. OK. Have you ever been on medication for that? OK. Great, now I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just for general information purposes. So are you, are you working at the moment? What do you work as? OK, and you're living alone. OK, do you have any Pets at Home? Yes, OK, great. What I'd like to do now, if that's OK, John, is I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, OK? One of the things that we'd be worried about if someone's going to have an acute allergic reactions to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth or the soft tissues of the airway. And I can, I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back, mouth open wide, sit somewhere where there's good lighting. And I just want to have a look inside the throat, if that's OK. Perfect. OK, great. Now. Can can I just get you to do it again and just say are this time? OK, fantastic, brilliant. OK. John, based on how you look, how you're talking to me and how you're breathing and the appearance on your wrist, I don't feel that you're having. A life threatening allergic reaction. Now, it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite. It's it's a localized inflammatory reaction that is normal. And that immediate reaction, that redness and that's maybe slight swelling is usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has. Compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned breathing difficulties and emitted swelling. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now. But that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened initially, it's unlikely to happen later. OK, so we have like a stage 1 and stage 2 reaction for these types of bites. And usually if you're going to have their reaction, it will happen straight away. So we may be coming out of the danger zone now is, but I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens. So for example, you would have swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing. You might have something called Stridel, which is an inspiratory sound that you when you try and trying to breathe, it makes like a Raspberry sound like this. OK, thankfully you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me that this is a localised allergic reaction. However, anything changes. If anything deteriorates, either make an appointment with us or go straight to A&E. And in some cases, if it's if it's progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A&E rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us. OK, what I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines so you combine them with the counter. You can get puritan or chlorpheniramine. You can take 1 tablet, 4 milligrams up to about 6 times a day, OK. Or you can just take A1A day one, whichever is your preference. That's that's absolutely fine. There's no, no issue. That should be enough to control this. If the redness in your arm spreads and it feels hot or you know, you have signs of any localised infection, we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic. And like I said, if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing, that's open and we need to process that we need to someone. Needs to be taken urgently. Did you have any other queries or was there anything else that you were worried about? Yeah, over the counter, you don't need to. Any chemist will have it. You don't need a prescription for that. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually, than to get it by prescription. OK. Now, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a straightforward localised reaction to an insect bite. However, if it was to happen that you know this, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non specific rashes, we might need to think about blood testing. I don't think we're at that moment. Yeah. OK, so but that's something to bear in mind in cases becomes a recurrent pattern. OK then. So we'll even like that for now. OK, I'm going to leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it. I don't need to panic, but just for you to be aware what my symptoms are if those kind of things happen. Get back to us if you're feeling. Worried just have a little threshold for having a chat with us. Sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. All right then, John. OK, Well, we'll leave it at one. Come back to us if you have any further issues. My pleasure. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye, bye.","Hi there. I'm Doctor Deen Mirza from Babylon. Good morning.

That's great. Thank you. Sarah, Sir, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment? OK, so tell me what's been going on. OK, alright. Sorry to hear that now along with this fever and this, any other symptoms at all?  OK, All right. And so you you're having periods of when you're feeling hot and also periods when you're feeling cold as well? OK. And have you been taking your medication? Sure. When you say it's not helping, is it bring the temperature down at all? OK. All right. And can I just update, have you got any cough or cold or sore throat when you know anything like that? Which sort of symptoms are you getting other than the ones you've already mentioned to me? So have have you had any ear pain at all? OK. Just I just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body. So I'm going to go through some kind of systemic question. Have you had any diarrhea? OK. Have you got any next business at all? OK. All right. Do you have any headache? OK. OK, so you know your normal headache, where is that? In the back of the head or the front of the head? OK. And how long have you been having that for? Sure. OK, Have you got any rash in your body, in your hair at all? I need joints swollen or tender or sore. OK. All right. All right. And have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you're passing urine? OK, any painful urination at all? Are you passing urine more often than normal? OK. Have you been abroad anywhere recently? Where have you been? OK. And did you take malaria preventive medication when you went out there? Which one did you take? Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet? OK. And was it 1 tablet or was there another one that you would take on top of the first one? OK. And what were you doing out in Vietnam? Was it just saying the cities or going through villages or hiking? What kind of activities were you doing? OK. And did you do any kind of were you in rivers or things like that? Were, you know, how adventurous were you? Were you going out into the rivers? Were you going on beaches? I mean, how adventurous was your trip? Right, OK. Thank you for sharing that with me now. Do you have any other illnesses at all in the past? And that back pain, have you, have you seen anyone about that? Have they, have they given you any kind of diagnosis at all? Alright, are there any illnesses in your family at all? Sorry to hear that. How old is he when that happens? OK. Are you on any medication at all? OK. Do you have any allergies at all, Tony? And medication? OK, so hay fever. All right. Are you? You're working at the moment. What would you work as? OK. All right. And you're opposite with all vaccinations, hepatitis B, that kind of thing? OK. Sure I can. Sure. OK. And are you, are you a smoker at all? OK. And if you drink much alcohol? OK. And how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally? OK, that's good. All right. So. What I think we're going to need to do is we're going to need to bring you into one of our clinics, examine, and we're going to need to arrange some blood tests as well. OK, So what what I want to do is the first question that I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fear, this fever and these symptoms because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me, there's no when someone has got fever. And sweats, we want to find out, have they got chest infection? Have they got a throat infection? And if we can't find a focus of infection, then that's something that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered. OK. The second thing, second factor is that you've recently come from Vietnam and you've had exposure to rural areas and we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well. So you're probably going to need some blood tests after you've been seen by somebody. Now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go for the examination first. You can come into one of our clinics in central London, that's one option. And then the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be. Or if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you're living further out, you could actually just attend a local A&E. I'm going to type up what my thought process is. And what kind of tests I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them at reception. I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers and things like that. Technical terms, but they'll understand what that what I'm talking about. But I don't think you can go into work until we've sorted this out and we need to sort this out sooner rather than later. OK. OK, fine. So what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in. And if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes and then they'll stop you in and then we can sort things out from there, OK. Alright then, OK, take care then. All the best. Bye.","Hi, good morning! Hi there, this is uh this is Doctor Dean from . OK, sure, I'll try.

OK, I've really not been feeling so well at all recently. I've been struggling with fever for the past week. Yeah, I would say it's last about seven days ago. I'm just, I'm really hot and sweaty all the time and just generally not feeling good. I'd say that I'm aching all over really. My muscles are really aching, feeling quite nauseous, so I've not been able to eat very much and I have been drinking but it's been quite a small amount. Yeah, just generally quite tired and unwell and sweating during the night and quite cold. Yes, yeah, it's quite interchangeable, not really a pattern to it. I've been trying to like take ibuprofen and paracetamol just from over the counter but it's not really helping. Just been taking the recommended dose every day of those. Perhaps slightly yes, but I'm still experiencing these symptoms so it does take the edge off of it. Not those sort of symptoms, really. I am. So I have, I have a that is mainly just the sweating really and the, and the nausea that's overtaking all day and the aching muscles all over. No, my ears are fine. Actually I haven't had any problems with my ears. This. And. Not, not really, no, no, I've been fine. No. It's been fine. Not more than usual, no. Just like the general headaches, but not just from staring at the screen. Nothing. No migraines or anything. It's quite centralized over over the head. Let's say. It's something that I've struggled with through years. Really just related to a screen use or like changes in weather patterns, high pressure days. Sometimes I struggle with migraines and headaches. I haven't noticed any rashes, no. Not really. I mean I often have problems with back pain, but not really any other joints. Any problems? No, there's been no problems there. Not at all, no. I don't think so, no. It's been fairly regular. Yes, I have actually. I went to Vietnam. I came back four weeks ago now. I did, yes. Oh, I can't remember now off the top of my head. I think it was daily. I think it was another one that I took on top of the first one. It was quite mixed really because we were there for a few weeks and we toured several different parts of the country and the countryside and some cities as well. I'm sorry, could you repeat that? I missed that. Yes, it was quite adventurous. We were sort of trekking and cycling through farmland and seeing how people lived in their day-to-day life and in farmland. As I said, I've been struggling with back pain for quite a while, but I haven't really had any major illnesses in the past I can think of. Yes, yeah, I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that. They've said that it's related to long periods of time sitting at a desk and just bad posture. So mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and and strength of the muscles in the back. The main one would be heart attack. My my father passed away with that. In his 60s. 68, I think, yeah. Just Sarah's that. No, I've just really pollen allergy. That's all I have. Yes, yeah, I just take fever. I am, yes. I work as a nurse. Yes, indeed. Yeah. But I'm I'm really struggling quite a lot of work at the moment. It's been quite difficult feeling so tired all the time. No, I'm not. Moderate alcohol intake. Yeah, I don't drink too much. I try and do some moderate physical exercise a few times a week. OK. OK.  OK.  OK.   OK, that, that sounds great. Thank you so much for your help.

day2_consultation10_doctor,"Hello, good afternoon. Hi there, this is Doctor Dean Miser from GP at Hand. Hi Anthony, So could I have your before we start, can I have your full name and date of birth if that's possible? That's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're OK to speak? OK, great. So how can I help you today? Sure. OK. And. Did the pain wake you up? What time do you wake you up? And what time do you normally get up? Right, OK, Is the headache still present now? OK, Have you had this kind of pain before? So there were less severe. Were they similar in nature in terms of being 1 sided and the type of pain? OK. All right. And can I just double check, do you have any next stiffness at all? OK. And do you have any fever? All right. How are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights or can you can you tolerate them? All right, OK. OK. And can I just double check, are you feeling nauseous at all? OK, And can I just double click? Does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that? Have they been diagnosed with migraines? OK. And are you under any particular stress at the moment? Right. OK. And how long has that been the case for? How would you say your mood is? OK, do you have have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past? OK. Are you taking searching at the moment? OK. And how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment? OK, all right now. Sorry to Arthur. Just need to ask for anyone suffering. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself? Now with regards to this header, is it worse when you lie down or is it is it better when you lie down? OK. So would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down or you're not? OK. And in terms of this headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet? Does that help? OK. Anything else at all? OK. Do you have any other illnesses at all? Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure? Have you ever had your blood pressure checked? OK. And are there any illnesses in your family? OK. All right. And are you on any medication? Do you have any allergies to any medication? All right. And are you living by yourself at the moment or are you doing with someone else? OK, are you a smoker? OK. And do you have any Pets at Home? OK. And can I just double check how much exercise would you do normally a week? OK. And what's your diet like? OK. All right. Now in terms of this headache, obviously I haven't been able to examine you see you directly, but it sounds like it might be one of two things. It could be an element of what we call tension headache. That's one possibility. And what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past, OK. The other possibility is migraine as well. OK. And the fact, what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side. And that you've got some sensitivity to light. OK, So what what I think we can do is I think we can give you some generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches. OK, so I'll tell you this in a second. And the other thing that I was going to suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work so. The medication wise, the things that we start off first line if someone had migraine was to would be to start. Ibuprofen and. That the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses of ibuprofen. So that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like, but the ibuprofen is actually more effective for migraine. And yeah, so the guidelines have changed recently. We used before that we used to give paracetamol's first line, but now it's ibuprofen and aspirin. That's the thing. The other thing I'd like to do is maybe consider taking some time off work, OK? Because if they're due to stress from work. Maybe you're having a week off? If you self certify that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore counselling options as well. So there's a counselling service in your area that I can give you the link for you to self refer. I'd like you to. OK, let's try that. What we're going to do is we'll have a follow up in a week's time. As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of 70 hours sleep at night, every night, a minimum of 1.5 to two litres of water or fluids a day. And that's not including coffee or tea. All right, because sometimes dehydration and you know of fatigue can because of headaches as well. Yeah. So that that is, you know, we need to rule those things out. Let's let's try that. OK, let's have a follow up appointment. If we're finding that things are not getting better, we might need to arrange some blood tests or look at other possibilities. But we'll try that in the first instance. If anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse. Feel free have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment and we can reassess the situation. OK, no problem. So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes, and I'll also leave a link to some of the danger signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes. If you can read through that in your own time, that will just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor. No problem. OK. So we'll, we'll touch base in a week's time with me, myself or one of the other doctors and we could, we'll take it from there, OK. Brilliant. OK then. All right, take care then.

You didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at light or something. So those are things when we think of meningitis. But and then it's the in meningitis, you get a non blanching rash while in any kind of virus, you know, the rash usually goes away saying that. We don't know whether these are the beginning stages. So that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see AGP as soon as possible if we've got a slot available.

Would you say you're depressed? Yeah, it's a tough one, isn't it? Because you don't want to actually say. Do you think your work? Do you like your work? You like your work OK and and how are things at home all right? Are you having any kind of stress at all? And have you lost any weight? OK. Right. So you mentioned that you've lost your appetite for a while now. So how long are we talking about? We're talking about two months, three months or six months if you could have been. We did a half months ago but you said your weight loss is a much longer than that. Sorry, could you? I couldn't hear you. What did you say? Your weight loss? How long? Roughly 6 months would you say? Six months and roughly how much have you lost just approximately? So about Estonia, 6 months. OK, OK. Right. OK, so just a few more questions. It might seem a bit awkward, but it's quite relevant. OK, so how are your bowels? Are they OK? Yeah, your bowels. How's your toilet? OK. So you're not going to the toilet? You are going like to be very more specific. You don't have any diarrhea. OK, so there's blood in the pool, no mucus, nothing of that sort. Just, you know, you mentioned nausea. Have you been ever sick with it? So then. OK, just the nausea. OK. Is there any particular foods that make you nauseous? OK, so you can't think of any meal? Do you suffer from acid reflux? OK. OK. You also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath. So do you? Yeah. Is there any? Cough. OK. Yeah. Is it like in closed spaces? So how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath? So how far can you walk with no shortness of breath? Walk. We'll start with walk. Do you feel shorter? Let's start this way. Do you feel sure to work breath when you walk at all? Right, you so you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all. OK, so just explain a bit more just to make myself clear about the lift thing. So you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift. You're describing, like, palpitations to me. Yeah. So that's what you're if you're feeling your own heartbeat, Yeah. OK, do you get any chest pains with it? OK, no chest pains. OK. All right, fine. So what we need to do just before that, just a few more things. Any, any past medical history you'd like to share with me today? Sorry you had thyroid problems. Oh, yeah. Under active thyroid, yes, yeah. Yeah, you're taking thyroxine. Are you using it every day? Why is that? OK, so is that so? All these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine? When was your last blood test? OK, So you've not had a blood test? Right. OK. It could you know generally for you know it for under active thyroids what symptoms you've said? It's the opposite that usually happens. Yeah, it's for all active thyroid. Like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heartbeat. And also, I'm not quite clear what picture we are having here. Yeah, I think a general set of bloods is a good idea. Good start. So what we look at, because you're not, you're not having the umm, aren't you? You're like you just read. Feeling a bit, you know low and things like that right So and weak and things like that. So we'll just do a general set of bloods where we look at things like anaemia, how your kidney functions, are your livers, all that with vitamin levels and your OK. Now after we get those set of bloods we will find out if we can find anything in there. If that's all clear then we would need to do a physical examination. OK, we would need to go in and do the thing, but there's nothing from what your history you said that that we urgently were into physical examination at this point in time. I think it's a good idea to start off with the blood test and then take it from there. Obviously with palpitations or chest pain, if you get that's more of a medical emergency, you need to go to A&E for that. OK, If things change, you've mentioned now your bowels are fine and you're not being sick. So if that's the. It's OK, but if your, you know, bowels change or you're being sick again, you need to get in touch with us, OK? Sorry, could you repeat that? Mm-hmm. OK, so let's do all the blood tests 1st and we'll take it from there, OK? But you know, if you have any chest pain or change in bowel habits, do get in touch with us. OK, now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support and I'll do the form for you. But in the interim, you need to call support so that we can organize that blood test for you. And once we get the result, you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment. If you're feeling poorly, don't wait for that. Just get in touch with us again, yeah. Oh, there's a number on your app. Yeah, if you open up your app, there's the number on there. It's an O300. Number. So just call that number.

And your e-mail address for me please. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Right. So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw. Is that correct?  OK, so numbness in the left arm, Yeah. How long has it been going on for? Mm-hmm.  Right. So have you mentioned a massage and a warm bath? Any medications that you've taken so far?  OK. MMM. Sure. Of course also from you've just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards, is that you know the tingling, numbness elbow below, not from your shoulder.  Yeah. So which fingers do you feel now? Uh-huh. Second, third and fourth finger. And is it your palm side or you know the back of your hand side which is numb or both? It's the front side, OK, Right. And have you been dropping things at all? Like, you know, when you try to hold on to things like a glass or something, have you been dropping it? Mm-hmm. So you would say there's a mild weakness? Mild. So just to get my facts right, so you definitely weakness rather than because of the pain you can't hold it. There's two different things. So you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you. OK. Fine. So you have definitely having some some form of weakness, OK any, any neck pain at all? OK. Right. OK. So just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Do you have any past medical history that you'd like to share? Mm-hmm.  OK. Mm-hmm. Yup. Do you have any headaches at all in the recent past? MMM. Do you wear glasses at all? Glasses. Contact lenses? No. So no glasses, right?

Yeah.  Ya, right. Any neurological conditions in the family? There are related conditions, no. OK, that's fine. OK. So, yeah, so after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, your cell phone, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here. OK, few things that's made me think other than just like a boxing injury is, for instance. You know when you said you can't, your vision went apparently was not there for about 20. So and that with the weakness of the arms make me think is there something else going on rather than just an injury? Sometimes, you know, you do get things like Ms. multiple sclerosis, so people with multiple sclerosis can have visual problems like what you've experienced. And sometimes, you know, the odd numbness, tingling sensations going on. OK. If we catch it a bit early, there are treatments for it. OK, I'm not obviously, I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not, that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be dealt with here. Yeah. So what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah. What they, what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that. Hello. I know this it might sound a bit of a shock to you, but but I think it is important that we investigate this a bit more seriously. OK. Any questions at all? No, that's something we can't do. The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that when you have an acute, you know, acute reaction or things like that. But saying that first we need to adopt firm diagnosis. Yeah. Why? Why You're waiting for this to be done. If there's any weakness, you know if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headache. Vomiting fits and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better. Then that would be an A&E. All right. Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry. I, I, I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling. OK.

day3_consultation09_patient,"Hi. Hi. Sure. My name is Mary Smith. My date of birth is August 16th, 1976. My e-mail address is mary.smith@gmail.com. Absolutely. Well. I think that's just like the first thing that I typed, but it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit. So that was, I mean, it's part of the problem, but I would say that more of a problem for me is that I can't quite move my left arm. I mean, I can move it, but it's, it's numb. And then I also feel some like tingling in my fingertips. Yes, yes. So I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking boxing class for a few weeks and I feel like maybe. It's probably been, I'd say for at least two weeks and it's kind of gotten worse. Like in the beginning I just kind of felt a little bit of tingling and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then. Then the numbing kind of started. I can feel it both in my, you know, a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand. And now, because it hasn't gotten better, I tried to get a massage. It's not better. Or, you know, try to take warm baths. It's not better. So I figured I'd call you and and just figure out what's going on. Well, it's. You know, it's, it's numb and I, I kind of looked stuff online, but you know, I, I do take ibuprofen just because my, my muscles were sore a little bit and I've been taking this boxing class. So you know, I kind of heard like my knuckles on my right hand. So that's been a little bit painful. So I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that. But like I said, I mean, I tried massage, I tried some hot baths and that didn't help with this numbness. I'm just kind of getting a little worried. Which? Well, it's kind of funny, you know, sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder, like if I try to, if I try to like, you know, move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain. But I would say if I'm just like resting, if I'm sitting like right now, I can feel like it's numb and I I actually feel tingling right now, not in all of my fingers, just in some. OK, so it's my second, third and fourth finger. No, it's, it's the, it's this side, so the front side. Yes. So not so much with the glass, but I will say, well, I play a little bit of a piano And so I just noticed that it's it's been kind of harder to get the notes. I can, I can grasp, I can grasp a glass, but because I use my right hand most of the time. You know, I'm not left-handed, so it's kind of hard for me to. Yes. Yeah. No, no, it's not hurting. It's not hurting. It's like numb. I can't feel it right. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. No, not no neck pain. Well, I guess because of this, you know, I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold like a month ago. I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with friends. One of our coworkers just had his three-year anniversary and we kind of went crazy and we were like out partying until, you know, late hours and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me. And then after that I was sick for probably good like 2 weeks. I was at home. I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something. So that, and then I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the from my left eye, like I, I lost some like a little bit of a field of vision. And but that, that just lasted not very long. I mean, that just lasted maybe for, I don't know, 2020 minutes. And I kind of thought, I don't know, maybe it was the, the cold, you know, and the virus and all that. So I, I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember. But in general. I'm, I'm pretty healthy. I mean, I, you know, I work out a lot and I, I don't really have any medical problems. Sometimes I get headaches, but I think they're just tired headaches. You know, sometimes I'll get kind of tired, but I think that's probably because I work too much or, you know, because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue. Or sometimes like this morning, for example, I just felt really fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But you know, since I have this numbness, it's kind of like hard to work out, right? No. What's a seizure? Oh no, no, no, no. Nothing like that. Yeah, yeah, walking is normal, Yeah. You know, I think it was only maybe like 20 minutes or so. It's almost like it happened and I thought, Oh my God, it's probably, I'm still like sick from this, you know, virus thing cold. And so I just kind of slept it off and then when I when I woke up, it was gone. Not really, I just take ibuprofen every once in a while. I take vitamin DI take some I I like my G My GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know, there are this like huge pills. So I, I'm most of the time I just forget but vitamin DI take and then sometimes I take melatonin to help me sleep. I know that my dad has, I don't know if it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism. And then my like he's, he's got some autoimmune stuff going on like that much I know. And then my mom, my mom she's she's actually not in a great shape. She's got diabetes type 2, She's got hypertension. She's got, gosh, what is it? Oh yeah, she's got high cholesterol. And I think that's it for her, yeah.  OK. What? What do you think may be going on? Oh. Oh my God, will I be in wheelchair? OK. OK, OK. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm here. Yes. Alright, yeah, that makes sense. Well, what's? OK, so you're going to do the referral? Should I be taking any drugs or? Yes, OK. OK, got it. Sounds good. OK. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, Doctor. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Bye bye.","Hi. Sure, my name is Mary Smith.

day3_consultation10_doctor,"Hello. Hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please? And your date of birth. OK. And your address for me please? OK. And that's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation, OK. You've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. Sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please? OK. MMM. MMM. So you haven't had anything from outside? Nothing dodgy? Anything but no. Y. Mm-hmm. Repeat that please. That wasn't clear. What did you say? One after that we said something. OK, right. And with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet? Four to five times, yeah. Is there any? And it's like water. Is it like water or is it just loose? Are you going like water or is it just, you know, bit bit of solid stews, bit loose kind of thing? A bit of both. And is there any blood or mucus? It's like the snotty stuff. Yeah, it looks like it's not. So no mucus, OK? Any fever at all? Are you still able to eat and drink? OK. Sure. So, but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit. Yeah, you're drinking plenty. OK, excellent. OK. And what have you taken? Have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea? Nothing yet. OK anything for the abdominal pain? OK. Right. And any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical histories that anything you'd like to say. Mm-hmm. OK. And are you any, anything else other than asthma? OK. Yeah. Oh dear, OK, bowel cancer 10 years ago. And how old was he when he died? OK. And you mentioned you had asthma. Are you using any inhalers at all? Which ones? Sorry. Lexapro. OK, not heard of it. I mean is it like salbutamol? Is it like a blue colour? Yellow. OK, I'll have to check that one. Not sure black seed through. OK. That's fine. Any other medication that you're using over the counter, anything at all. Regularly now, OK. Right. Any allergies? No allergies at all right here. Fine. So obviously, you know, you just have diarrhea. It's about four to five times a day. You're still drinking plenty, and you look like you're not dehydrated, which is a good sign. OK, Then we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day, that means probably you are, you know, whatever you're eating is going straight through. OK, you still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids, OK, when you go to the toilet. Things that one would advise is a soft diet, so avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs. While you're having the diarrhea go sorry. OK, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things that's easily digested, like what we would give babies. Yeah. When they start eating, you give simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about. Yeah. Once you are able to, you know, keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash. Once you're OK with that for about 48 hours, then you can start having meat. So just don't have me immediately once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square 1 again. What, 48 hours? You're not having any diarrhea, you're fine. Then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all. So that's when you. No, no, no, you preferably just don't because why do we say this? This because it takes much more time for me to get digested. So because your gut flora, you know, the the bacteria in your gut is not, you know, as it should be. It takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food, while it doesn't take that much of an effort to, you know, digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense? Yeah, so at the same time you could have some, although you can't eat milk is not a good idea. Yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics. It helped to build up the normal. Gut, gut bacteria back. OK, so those kind of now things to look out for if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood. We need a stool sample. Because that means you might you may have. Some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics. OK. If you again, as I've mentioned previously, if you're going about 6 to 8 times a day, that means there's a high chance that you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens, you get in touch with us again, all right. Any questions? You look a bit confused. Yeah, OK. And also you could get something called diary light over the counter. So it helps to replenish your the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet. OK. If you're a bit confused, you know, you can actually, uh, all this is all recorded in your app, so you can go back. I'll put that all in detail. So if you know, I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read, read the notes. Is that OK? All right then. You take care. Bye now. Bye bye.","Hello, hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please? And your date of birth? OK, and your address for me please. OK and that's correct, and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. OK, uh, you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please. OK. Mmm. Mm-hmm. So you haven't had anything from outside? Nothing dodgy anything ? No. Mm-hmm. Repeat that please, that wasn't clear. What did you say? After that we'd said something. OK, right, and with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet? Four to five times, yeah. And is there any? And it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose? Are you going like water? Or is it just, you know bit, bit of solid stools, bit loose kind of thing? Sure OK. Bit of both and is there any blood or mucus? It's like the snotty stuff. Yeah, it looks like snot . No, so no mucus, OK. Any fever at all? Mm-hmm. Are you still able to eat, and drink? OK. Sure. So but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah? You're drinking plenty. OK. Excellent. OK, and, um, what have you take, have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea? Nothing yet, OK. Anything for the abdominal pain? OK. Right, and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history, is there anything you'd like to say? Mm-hmm. OK and uh, are you, any, uh, anything else other than asthma? OK. Yeah . Ohh dear, OK. Bowel cancer. Ten years ago. And how old was he when he died? K, and um, you mentioned you had asthma, are you using any inhalers at all? Which ones? Sorry? Laxepro. OK, not heard of it may. Is it like Salbutamol? Is it like a blue colour? Yellow, OK. I'll have to check that one, not sure. Laxepro. OK. Um, that's fine. Any other medication that you're using? Over the counter, anything at all? OK. Right. Any allergies? No allergies at all, righty . Fine so, obviously, you know you just have diarrhea it's about four to five times a day. Um, you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign, OK? Um, when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day. That means probably you are, you know, whatever you're eating is going straight through, OK? You still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids. OK, when you go to the toilet. Um, things that one would advise is a soft diet. So avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs, while you're having the diarrhea. Go, sorry? OK, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things that's easily digested. Like what we are good give babies yeah. When they start eating you give, simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about, yeah? Once you are able to, you know keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash. Once you're OK with that for about forty-eight hours then you can start having meat. So just don't have meat once you feel like you're slightly better, because you might go back to square one again, all right? Forty-eight hours you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all. So that . No, no, no preferably just don't because, what why do we say this? It's because it takes much more time for meat to get digested. So because your gut flora, you know, the, the, the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food. While it doesn't take that much of an effort to, you know digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense? Yeah? So, um, at the same time you could have some, although you can't milk is not a good idea, yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics, it help to build up the normal, um gut, gut bacteria back. OK. So those kinda, now, things to look out for, if your diarrhoea doesn't go away in a week's time, or if you're passing blood, we need a stool sample, because that means you you may have , um, some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics. OK. If you're again, as I've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that, uh, you are, having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens you get in touch with us again, all right? Any questions? You look a bit confused. Yeah? OK and also you could get something called Dioralyte over the counter. So, it helps to uh, replenish your, the salts that you've been, that's lost through going to the toilet. OK? If you're a bit confused you know you can actually, uh, all this is all recorded in your app. So you can go back. I'll put that all in detail so if, you know I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read, read the notes. Is that OK? All right then, you take care.

day4_consultation01_doctor,"Hello. Yeah, I can. Can you hear me? Hi, my name is Doctor Gohil. I'm one. Hi, I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon. Are you in a quiet and private space to talk Good. And can I confirm your name and date of birth please? 74 and how old does that make you? Perfect. Great. And it says here, it says you're having chest discomfort. Is that correct? Great. OK. Can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment?  OK. Great, so you've talked about your chest. Are you still in discomfort at the moment? OK. And when it started, how would you rate it out out of 10? OK. And how about now? OK, And tell me, before this happened, what were you doing? OK. OK. And how often do you do gardening? OK. And are you normally fit and well? So are you normally OK to garden as you would? Great. And apart from this, do you have any other medical problems? OK, so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you take any medications for that? OK. And are you allergic to anything? OK so let me summarize what you've told me already. You regarding a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort which was roughly 7 out of 10 and it feels more like someone sitting on your chest as opposed to pain. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing? OK. And is that getting worse or better? And when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? OK, so let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath, is that correct? So given what you've told me about your past medical history. I think it might be worth you calling an ambulance and get you to the hospital as soon as possible because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So while I talk to you, I will ring an ambulance who should come to your address. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics. Is that OK? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got some chest pain, I'm always worried about the heart first before anything. And we need to look after your heart before anything else. So apart from this Lightheadedness and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? Do you have anything to eat or drink this morning? And you feel still feel nauseous at the moment. So I have a couple of other questions to ask you and I'm going to reel them off. So apologies for not letting you talk very much. Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head? And how about your left or right arm? And does that pain go anywhere else, to your left arm or to your back? And have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water? Good. And have you noticed any problems going to the loo? And you're normally fitting well, apart from the two things you told me about. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? OK, I would suggest if she's there, you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today, so she might need to get your things together. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to. Don't take any of those medications. The paramedics should be with you very shortly. So when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. The one is your chest, so your heart, and the second is your breathing, which is your lungs. So they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate. So don't be worried. And when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant pretty pretty much immediately. Right. Sure. So I will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going. Great, I'll book another appointment to see you soon once you've had your adventure. No problems. Do you have any questions for me? Great. Thank you very much. OK.","Hello. Yeah, I can.

And do they all happen at the same time? Or is it one thing, one time and 1:00? OK, so let's start with the headaches. When they do come, do you have any idea that the headache is going to come? So it's normally at work. OK, and where does the headache sit in your head? So the front or the back? OK. And does it go anywhere else? Does it go anywhere else? And when you have the headaches specifically, do you feel sick? OK. OK. And do you normally get headaches before all of this started? OK. And then let's. OK, so talk to me about your job. What do you do? And do you work in London at the moment? So do you get these headaches on your commute into work? OK, and tell me about what you do. Do you sit in front of a computer most of the time or do you speak to people? OK. And these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer. OK, and tell me, what did you do before being a lawyer? OK, So talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment. If 10 out of 10 is extremely stressful and one out of 10 is being on vacation where at the moment? And is that normal for you? OK. So you mentioned your headaches. You also mentioned your reduced appetite, so you don't want to eat as much. Have you lost weight? Can you remember how much you've lost? And is that because you're going to the gym or is that unintentional? OK. So have you noticed your clothes feeling looser? And have people said or commented that you've lost weight? Great. And another thing that you also mentioned is that you notice tingling in your hands. So talk to me about that. Is it in one hand or both hands? And do you get that in your legs as well? And what does it feel like? The tingling? And again, is this the first time you've noticed this? OK. And the other two things that I've just jotted down is you're feeling hot, but you didn't mention that. Is that correct? OK. Yes. So do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk? OK. And how about when you're exercising? OK. And the last thing is you mentioned that you noticed your heart beating. Again, how often do you get that? OK. How long has that been happening for? Fine. And apart from all of these things that you've told me, do you have any other medical problems? OK. And do you take medications for that? And are you remembering to take your medications? OK. And do you drink or smoke? How much do you drink? And how about smoking? And I need to ask this to all of my patients, but do you do anything else recreational in terms of drugs? OK, so you've never taken cocaine or marijuana? OK. Thank you. And are you allergic to anything? Good. So you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment and I can understand they probably feel quite strange and unusual. I think the best course of action is you come and see one of our doctors in the clinic, we can give you an examination and what that means is we check your heart and your breathing, make sure that those things are functioning correctly and probably do some blood tests for your thyroxine. And take it from there. How does that sound? I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person. So what we're going to do is book an appointment, or I think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see. One of my colleagues, I'll let them know what you've told me today, so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said. Great. Do you have any questions?

You also mentioned your reduced appetite. So, you don't want to eat as much. Have you lost weight? Can you remember how much you've lost? And, is that because you're going to the gym? Or is that unintentional? OK. So, have you noticed your clothes feeling looser? And, have people said, or commented that you've lost weight? Great. And, another thing that you also mentioned. Is that you noticed tingling in your hand. So, talk to me about that. Is it in one hand? Or both hands? And, do you get that in your legs as well? And, what does it feel like, the tingling? And again, is this the first time you've noticed this? OK. And the other two things that I've just, jotted down. Is, you're feeling hot, but you didn't mention that. Is that correct? OK. Yes. So, do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk? . OK. And, how about when you're exercising? OK. And the last thing is. You mentioned that you noticed your heart beating? Again, how often do you get that? OK. How long has that been happening for? Fine. And, apart from all of these things that you've told me. Do you have any other medical problems? OK. And, do you take medications for that? And, are you remembering to take your medications? OK. And, do you drink or smoke? How much do you drink? OK. And, how about smoking? And, uh, I need to ask this to all of my patients, but do you do anything else recreational, in terms of drugs? OK. So, you've never taken cocaine, or marijuana? OK, thank you. And, are you allergic to anything? Good. So, you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand, they probably feel quite strange and unusual. Um, I think the best course of action is, you come and see, one of our doctors, in the clinic. We can give you an examination, and what that means is, we check your heart and your breathing. Make sure that those things are functioning correctly. And probably do some blood tests, for your thyroxine. And take it from there. How does that sound? I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person. So, what we're going to do is book an appointment. Or I think you can book an appointment through the app, to come and see us clinic, and see one of my colleagues. I'll let them know what you've told me today, so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said. Great. Do you have any questions?

day4_consultation03_doctor,"Hi. Hi, can you hear me good? My name is Doctor Gohil. I'm one of the physicians that works here at Babylon. Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please? 1983 And are you in a space that's private and quiet and you can talk? Good. So it says. I've got a note to say it says you're feeling short of breath. Is that correct? OK. Are you able to tell me a little bit more about that? This is while you're sitting watching TV. OK. And have you noticed anything like this before? OK, and apart from the shortness of breath, have you noticed anything else? OK. OK. And how long ago was that? Just a few weeks? OK. And are you with baby at the moment? And how is baby doing? OK. Any coughs or colds with them? OK, so you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour while sitting and watching TV, and you had your C-section a couple of weeks ago and yesterday you noticed a cough. So talk to me about the cough. Have you brought anything up? And when was the last time you were ill with flu or symptoms like this? OK. And this shortness of breath you're having, is it getting worse? OK, so you're feeling your heart more than normal. And the shortness of breath, does it cause any pain in your chest? How about when you take a very deep breath in? OK. And since your C-section, did you have to take any medications? And can you remember what the name of those were? And have you had to use that regularly? OK. And apart from the C-section and the shortness of breath, have you got any other medical problems I should know about? And are you aware? OK. And what happens when you take ibuprofen? So I need you to do something for me. Have you measured the rate of your heart before? Have you measured it recently, either with an iWatch or something similar? OK, we might need to do that over the phone. So are you able to put your right hand on your left wrist just underneath your thumb and see if you can feel your heartbeat? So what you need to do is when I count to three, countdown from three, just count the number of beats you've noticed and I'll tell you to stop. Is that OK? So we'll start in 321 Go. Great, that should be enough. How many did you count? Good. So your heart is running slightly fast at the moment, which is probably because of your shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under. Given that you've had AC section and your short of breath, which has come on quite recently and quite quickly, it might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out a bit further. So there's two ways of us doing this. The 1st is I can call an ambulance or you can take yourself to the hospital with baby. Which one would you prefer? Sure. And what I would suggest is go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time. And if you're taking any medications like codeine, don't don't take them for the time being. Is anyone else with you at home? OK. So I think that's the best thing to do for the time being. So what I'm worried about at the moment is, given that you've had AC section, some people can suffer with clots. And those can either be found in the legs or your chest, so in your lungs. It's quite a common thing to happen and it's not something to worry about but needs to be checked out in the hospital 1st. And if it if that does become the case, they can give you something to reduce the clock really quick process. Good.

day4_consultation05_doctor,"Hi, can you hear me? Hi, my name is Doctor Gohil. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Can I can I check your name and date of birth please? OK. OK. And are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? So you're 48 and are you able to talk at the moment? OK, tell me. It says here you have a, you're, you're having problems going to the toilet. OK.  OK, tell me how you were three days ago before this started. Did you have any medical problems? OK. OK. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? OK. OK, so you. You've had the diarrhea for three days and now you're having pain and vomiting. Was the diarrhea been getting better or worse? OK. OK. And how often do you go to the toilet? OK. That must be hard. Have you had to drink more water than normal? OK. An important question, have you noticed any blood? And you mentioned tummy pain. Can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is and if it goes anywhere? Yeah. We've been able to eat and drink. MMM. And you said the tummy pains in the middle of your tummy, does it go anywhere else? OK. And when was the last time you vomited? Did you have any breakfast? What do you? OK. And that and you vomited that up afterwards? Did you notice any blood when you vomit? OK. And. Did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? Yeah. OK. OK. OK, it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this. Probably it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing? OK. OK, and how about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? OK, and how about walking and talking? Are those all both OK? And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? OK. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain and it's normal. This is normally called gastroenteritis, so an infection over the tummy. Normally when patients have this, we have to do some things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment #2 is to make sure and look out for any fevers. So if you start getting a temperature. Then you need. And #3 is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better. And normally. Normally things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse. So that's. Go ahead. So I think that's what we should do for the time being. If you feel you're getting much worse then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real, in real life, in person so they can look at your belly. OK. Great, cool. Do you have any more questions for me? Yeah, so the the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had. But if your things don't get worse then that's something that we can look at from the GP. Does that sound OK? Thank you very much. Bye bye.","Hello? Hi, can you hear me? Hi, my name is Doctor Gohil.

day4_consultation06_doctor,"Interesting. Hello. Hi, my name is Doctor Kumar. I'm one of the GPS here. Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me please? Date of birth. And your date of birth. Again, how can I help today?  OK, so this, it started this morning, was a sudden onset headache. Did it come on suddenly? OK. And did it come on really bad or did it start off like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache? And if you if 10 is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how bad would you say the pain was between 1:00 and 10:00? 6 out of 10. Thank you. OK, now that's fine. Have you ever had a headache before? Have you ever had a headache like this in the past? OK, so the first. OK, OK. If you had to say where across the head the headache is, it's across the front, around the back. And tell me what visual problems are you getting? OK. OK, and have you tried any painkillers for this already? OK. OK. What time did you take the party tomorrow? How long ago was it you're taking it? OK. And your visual problems is still ongoing now?  OK, OK, So what about have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit? Still finished. All right, OK. You've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones. Any other medical problems? You've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? What else do you have in the family? Oh, can you still hear me? You can hear me, you said. You mentioned your mother has migraines. What else do you have in the family? Hypothyroid. OK, fine. OK. And no other relevant family history. And do you take any regular medications? Are you allergic to any medications? OK, is there any chance you could be pregnant? Fine. And so you're not allergic to any medications fine from and what, what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seem quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about?  OK, OK, fine. Now just another question. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that? And when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line. Or is your your walk? Are you walking a bit funny? OK. OK, So just just to clarify what what you said this morning, you woke up and then later on in the morning about four hours ago, you've developed a headache mainly on the left side of the head, left side of the head, is it behind the eye? Is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is? You've also noticed that your position. OK, that's fine. You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, You vomited twice. And are you feeling dizzy as well? But you're you've got no neurological symptoms, you're walking fine and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped. Is that OK? So it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine. Is that something you've heard of before? OK. OK, so usually with with migraines, they can present at different times in people's lives. So sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older, and sometimes they can present, you know, even postmenopausally. So there's different, there's different ways you can get migraines. And the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head, which is typical of a migraine. You've got blurry vision again, which is very typical with a nausea and vomiting that's also. Critical of a migraine. Now the obviously if the headache is really severe and I'll suggest some medications you can try. If that doesn't work, we would want to see you as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well. To make sure that you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that everything all seems fine. I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, if you can take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen. So yes, a migraine, yeah, not, you know, even sooner than that. We can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes depending on what your response to it is. For some people, whatever medications they take, the migraine doesn't improve and and it can last from anywhere from 4 hours to 72 hours. Migraines can last, but I'll be no, So what there's lots of medication treatment so that they can be ibuprofen with an anti sickness so which you can get from the pharmacy. And you also to drink a sugary carbonated drink, something like Coke. So the three of them is a is a good sort of cocktail to start them. Then we can go up the treatment ladder. You can get specific my relief medication and that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the to do the assessment. Assessment where we can see you today at some point. But however, if you do take these medications and you know by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it and you can give us a call and cancel it.

OK, so how can I help today?  OK, so things have become quite difficult for you. Is there anything else? OK, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating, and that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? Roughly. When did you start your new year? Two months ago, you say? OK. And so this has been going on perhaps for sort of six weeks or so? OK, All right, so. Is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about or hoping to get out of this consultation?  OK, sure. OK. Well, what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on and also around your background health and things like that. And then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there. Is that all right? OK, great. So you say you've been feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to, just on that note, do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the morning? The difficulty sleeping as well. And have you? How? How has your mood been over this period? Have you been feeling your usual? OK, so difficulty focusing, quite distracted. And would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low? Alright. And. So. Lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well. And just on that note, just a few questions around that. Are you able to maybe slightly personal questions, but if you're OK to answer these, do you tend to to have morning erections like you? Is that something that you've noticed? So you've not, so you're saying that you have not noticed morning elections and usually you would such normal thing to have waking up in the morning with something, but you have not noticed those recently? OK, so and that's been a change. Sorry. So you don't think there's been a change there? Oh, OK, sorry. Right, Sorry. OK, so. Just going back to the mood symptoms as well. You've had difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been slightly lower with lower sex drive. And in what way is your sex drive been lower? Are you in a relationship at the moment? Who's interested? OK, so you phrased that for a moment. So less interested as well. OK. And just to ask you a few questions before we. Wrap up is any significant past medical history. So do you suffer from any mental health problems in the past or any physical health problems? No. Hypo. Perth, I wrote. So that's my thyroid, just to sort of confirm that. Hyper as in high hyperthyroid? Hypo. OK, Hypothyroid. Thank you. OK. OK. OK. And. Do you take any medications? Do you continue to take thyroxine now? You do you're so you're taking thyroxine at the moment. Cool. And any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications? No, no allergies. And you mentioned the the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other? Significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions. No depression or anything like that running in family or. OK. And your mother is as well. And your brothers or sisters. OK, so I just sorry my slightly random question, but any change in your vision? OK and just to go back to your you're saying you had low mood. Some people who who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else? No. And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past? OK, so you've become more short of breath over the last few months? And you've had. OK. So any other things around this? More fatigue, more shortness of breath over the last few months with a lower mood decreasing? Dr. is there just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about? So. Getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. I would like to probably see you in person and do an examination and and also we would probably like to do some blood tests as well. So do you think it'd be possible to see to book an appointment in the next few days with your GP or that would be ideal I think here. And then we can we can probably do some more, do an examination and do some investigations really to see what's going on here a little bit more. Is that all right? OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think, I definitely think we need a plan here. It's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry we run out of time now, but we've at least started the ball rolling with some further investigations and tests. I'm glad that you're, you know, you're you're, although you have a low mood and you're you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that.

So, um, We're getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. Um, I would like to, probably see you in person, and do an examination. And, and also, we would probably like to do some blood tests um, as well. So, do you think it would be possible to see uh, to to book an appointment in the next few days uh, with your GP? Or, or um, that would be ideal, I think here. Um, and then we can, we can probably do some more uh, we'll do an examination and uh, do some investigations really, to see what's going on here a little bit more. Is that alright? OK. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think , I definitely think we need a plan here. Um, it's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry, we've run out of time now. Uh, but we've at least started the ball rolling with um, some further investigations and tests. I'm glad you're, you know, you're, you're , you're, although you have a low mood, um, you're, you're, um, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that. And, and you're, uh, and uh, we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some your tiredness, and your other symptoms, when we see you. OK? OK. Thank you.

Hi Daniel and your date of birth? 92 OK Daniel, and are you in a comfortable and confidential place at all? Happy to go ahead. Great, how can I help? OK. And how long has this been going for, Daniel? OK. And so type test for three hours. And so you were born in 92, so it makes you 26. And you are any shortness of breath at all with that? Any cough, wheeze? Cycle, yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears. Are you feeling better now than the tight chest? Right. OK, OK. But you know, now you've got this this. So you've still got still got symptoms of a cold essentially. Yeah, OK. Are you coughing up anything? And do you have any other medical problems like asthma? OK. Do you have any inhalers or any any medications? Yeah. Can I modulate? Yeah, OK. And. Have you been using clinical and the Ventolin and how often you've been using them? Both of you. Yeah, sure. OK. All right. All right. So, so so you, you haven't got any clinical or any Ventolin at the moment? OK. All right. And any drug allergies, you know. OK, great. Now do you anyone in your family have any medical problems? No. OK. Right. So just do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on? Hopes for this consultation. Yeah, absolutely. I can. I can imagine. Well, it certainly sounds like you've you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough and it's non productive cough and you're short of breath. Is the cough worse at night time? Yeah. OK. And you've got this type type Jess, but you can tell you've got chest pain, there's more a tight chest, is that? Yeah, sure. OK. Well, I would quite like to certainly get you some Ventolin clinical modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Yeah. Have you ever been to the hospital as an inpatient, as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Oh, OK. So, so, so you, you have you went to hospital and had a, so you stayed in hospital for a few days to do with an asthma exacerbation. OK. But currently you're just on Ventolin and clinical and you haven't got any of those, those inhalers at the moment. OK. When sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthmatic dissipation? Sure, OK. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you? No, you won't have, will you? Are you able to? Like walk up flight of stairs OK Walk on the flat OK without getting too short breath. Or are you short of breath rest? Sure. Yeah. OK. But you're not sure about the rest at the moment? OK, fine. So what what I think and just just go over, is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this? Sure. Yeah, No, absolutely. Well, I'm really glad you talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for. Some more of the inhalers, we can get that to you within the hour I would hope. And I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which you can take for five days, 2 tablets in the morning. And that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, OK. Now, there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about, but please read the label. That's associated with don't be too worried about the side effects they're on most you know, most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and you have you had them in the past do you know of. Have you had steroids in the past? Probably yeah, so they they can come, they can make you your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar. And. That they can also cause rash, nausea, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot. What I'd like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing. So you can once you get better from this asthma attack, you can you can use the clinical modulate in the morning with Ventolin as APRN, but so a Ventolin when you need to when you're getting if you should start to use the Ventolin more than. Every three hours. At any time it's a good idea to seek medical attention so see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you? Do you know what spacer is? Have you used one before? Have you got 1? OK. All right. Well, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out. For five or five or 10 breaths. Yeah, so. Was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about this stage? OK. And I might give you some time off work as well. You can self certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're OK. Yeah. All right. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath or just generally concerning symptoms? Pain in chest tightness, Feeling lightheaded. Then seek further medical attention Anytime please. OK. Thank you. Bye bye.","Ohh hello. Hi, how you doing? Uh, my name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon.

I mean, from the sounds of it, it does sound quite like a migraine, but obviously even had no history of that in the past. And has anything changed recently or any anything you've done recently might have triggered it?

Or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that.

I would try and manage to get your blood pressure checked if you haven't had it checked for a while. And seem to do is to have a thermometer at home so you make sure that your temperature is OK.

day5_consultation03_patient,"Hi. My name is Valerie Cole, My date of birth is the 19th of September 1993. My address is 64 Cliveden Place in South Wimbledon. Yes, I am, yeah. I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. I just get really nervous every morning about leaving Hyacinth. It started to really worry me and just add up and build up on that anxiety and I just didn't know who to talk to you so I wanted to check with my GP. I guess so. I think I would say maybe about two months or so. I've been feeling like this and that's probably coincides with me starting a new job. Which I would say it's quite, I mean every job is stressful and when you first start, but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months. Definitely. So I work for. A fashion retailer in the head office team and it's just a brand new section. I've never worked in retail before. My boss is not very nice to me, but I also think that it's just been. I just really dread going there. I just hate speaking to her hate like seeing everyone and really worried about whether I'm doing well or not. And it's really impacting on like on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that. Right. Yeah, so, so I, I, I, as I say, like, I don't want to go to work in the morning. So I just find no way of I can't get out of bed. But it's also because when I leave, I just when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done. I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours so. About 1011 probably. Not for ages. I'm I'm lying awake all night. So I find my heart kind of racing and then I'm just like panicking that I'm going to be late and that that's going to make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that because I'm just, my heart is racing. And actually the other day I was just like, I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much. I thought I was going to have a heart attack in the morning. I just I can't even tell because I feel like I'm even when I'm in sleep. It's such a shallow sleep but maybe. 3-4 hours I'm getting now. Probably not. Significant changes, maybe. No, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say I mean like much differently. Oh, I probably have more chocolate than normal just because I feel so down. Yeah. So. Yeah. So it's, it's usually kind of like when I realise in the morning that either I feel like I'm going to be late because I've like overslept because I'm so tired, or I wake up in a panic thinking I'm going to be late. So it's just kind of like just a constant like rapid heart beating. It's really, really stressful. I don't know if it's stress or I did think it was like a heart problem initially. Irregular, I think. Oh, it can be anything. I think it was like a couple of minutes or the other day I was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like 10 minutes. Yeah, I would say this is only in the past sort of like a couple of months as I say that I've been experiencing this. No. Well, yeah, it's painful to when the heart, when my heart is beating fast, but but. Yeah. It's just really, really low. I'm, I'm finding out that I'm just, I find no enjoyment at all, kind of day-to-day. And anything that I'm doing, it's not just my job, it's, you know, when I leave, I'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not, it's not enjoyable and like, yeah, on edge the whole time. Well right now I'm working so late, everything is really stressful so I don't really get much time for myself. But when I do want to go out or you know, be friends or just relax. It it seems quite difficult to do that. I avoid them in so much that I feel like I'm yeah. So I mean, sometimes it just, I know that I'm not going to have fun because I don't want to go out and do things that I would normally have done. Yeah, as I say, like everything that I've had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with. Like I did used to like to like go running and to play tennis and stuff, but no, it's just not. I'm just not enjoying it. I'm not. I'm not like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much. No, because I think that would just add to the tension. But I do pretty much every morning. I think, oh, I should call in sick or like. It's not good. No I wouldn't say so. I think I've always managed to make it to work but I I wonder if it's building up. So This is why I want to call and I'm worried it's building up that I don't know what to do because I've had felt it get worse and worse over the past couple of months. Yeah, I mean, I find public transport really stressful in a way, especially being on the cheapest because it's quite getting warmer, so it's just really airless. But I think the majority of it, because my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Not really. I, I'm, no, I'm saying, I mean, everybody always has a bit of attention, a bit of anxiety, but I've never felt anything that's bad before. Yeah. I mean, yeah, yeah, because I do, yeah. I'm pretty much down. Like I don't enjoy it being my day at all because. I'm just so worried about everything and I find that even when I'm not like even at the weekends and stuff, it's just the kind of like constant feeling of just being a bit down, a bit unhappy. I don't know. That's a good question. I can't really, I can't really put a date on that at all. I wouldn't know, I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any thoughts that have been that extreme like I don't, you know, I have, I have a good support system, like I do have a good family and stuff. So I have, I don't have worries about actually wanting to not go on. It's just that I don't want to go on like this. Sorry. Yeah, I live with my parents. It's my parents. I don't know, probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because that's kind of normal. Maybe, maybe I do have like a bit during the week that my parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want. So whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me. And it's like, I guess I don't really keep track of it that much. Probably like probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday because it's usually going out. So maybe like. I probably go over my limit just on those days anyway and then like maybe a glass of wine during the week with dinner. I try not to smoke but I do occasionally but I don't take that. I talked to my mum because she also suffers from or she suffers from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was that I was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as as just stress the whole time. But I did talk to my mum. I haven't sought any. She recommended that I come to the GP but I haven't sought any other. Question. Yeah, I think, Yeah, I think so. I've never done that before, but yeah. Yeah.  OK.  OK. That's great, I look forward to reading it. OK, OK. Yeah. OK, I'll call them up. Thank you so much. Have a good day, bye.","Hi. Yeah. Uh, my name is Valerie Cole.

day5_consultation07_doctor,"Hi there. It's Doctor Smith from Babylon. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? And your home address. OK, that's fine. Are you in a private place that you can have a consultation at the moment? OK, what can I do for you today? OK, and and are you normally fit and well? Right. OK. So just tell me about the last. Did you say 5 days? OK, how about your cough at the moment? OK, you bring up any phlegm at all? No any chest warm. Any pain in your chest? Any difficulty breathing, feeling short of breath, or any pain when you take a deep breath? Have you coughed up any blood or anything like that? And what about your nose symptoms? Or anything. OK. And any blood coming from the nose? Right, OK. Any other symptoms like sore ears, sore throat? Have you had your temperature with the thermometer? OK. And are you eating and drinking normally? OK, so you're drinking while holding down fluids, OK. And passing water. OK, no vomiting, diarrhoea now. OK, that's fine. Any rashes? But you've noticed. Yep, any headaches or changing your vision? OK. And normally do you have any chest problems? Do you ever get wheezing short of breath? And do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment normally? OK. Any other medical problems? OK. And what type of drugs are you on? OK, and when did you last have your blood pressure checked? Do you know do you know if it's been stable? OK.

And do you smoke at all? Do you drink any alcohol? OK. And who do you live with at home? And do you work? OK. And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms, anything that you've brought in the chemist? Do you? What do you mean by quite a few? How many in a day do you normally take? OK. Have you noticed any improvement in that? OK. Do you have any allergies to anything? Any any allergies to any medications at all? OK, So what you've described to me, it sounds like you, you probably have got an infection in the chest because it's it, you know, you're obviously getting the symptoms of your nose and your chest. It sounds like you might have a high temperature, so it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature. Yeah, Most of the time these infections are caused by viruses, so they do normally settle by themselves, but it can take, you know, a week or two and you can consistently have the ongoing longer than that. The important thing to do would be to check your temperature and if you feel like if the temperature is ongoing above 37.538. And you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down or your coughs getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm, or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose or any shortness of breath, chest pain. Then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes, you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes. So it's something that we do need to be capable of. Yeah, potentially. If it is, if it's not settling, all the temperatures ongoing getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again. Have you got any other questions? It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the Lemsip. I wouldn't take and that's that contains proceeds more so don't take any other paracetamol containing products with that at the same time. The cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime. It's best for your body if you just keep coughing, but if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it's OK to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down. OK, do you have blood sugar checking equipment? She checked, No. OK, well if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GPS ask you for. OK, great. All right then take care. Bye.","Hi there, it's Doctor Smith from Babylon. Hi. Can you confirm you name, date of birth and your home address, please? Hello. And your home address? OK, that's fine.

day5_consultation11_patient,"Hi. Hi, Doctor. Yes, my name is Mary Jones. The date of birth is January 1st, 1980 and my address is 60 Sloan Avenue, London. Absolutely. So a couple of things. I, I think I may have overdone my workouts and now my knees are hurting and they're clicking a lot and it's starting to worry me. I can't run very far anymore without just feeling pain in my knees. And then sometimes I also get this weird tingling in my toes. So yeah, that's, that's it. I'm just concerned and I figured, you know, I'd call and see if you can help me figure out what's going on. So probably it's been about two weeks. You know, not, not really. I mean, I play a lot of sports and I had like, I played some ice hockey and I had this injury a few months ago. You know, I just like fell on the ice and and, you know, had a huge bruise, but I think that's about it. So I'm training, well, I'm currently training for a marathon. It's going to happen in June. And so I'm trying to run like, I mean right now I'm actually not even doing such long runs, maybe like 7 or 8 miles. And so I started about maybe a month ago. I'm like, you know, four or five miles and I've just done like a couple of seven mile runs and then. And then, you know, I go to the gym like 3 * a week and kind of do my usual routine. But yeah, I think the only thing that's really different has have been the runs, the longer runs. Well, what do you mean by that? I'm not sure what what it means. Not, not that. I mean, it just kind of starts hurting, you know? I would say it probably starts like after maybe 20 minutes or so, which is probably, I don't know, like somewhere around mile three, maybe 1 1/2 or 3 miles. Or maybe not. Maybe I'm switching my kilometers in miles. I'm not sure. All right. Yeah, that is a good question. So, you know, the last few times, the last time I actually stopped, I mean, I ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped because it was I, I feel like it's getting worse. And when I started doing my abs that, you know, when I do my apps, it kind of required me to move my, you know, to kind of go from the flex position of my knees and straighten my legs. Then I hear all this clicking and I think that also freaked me out. And I just figured, you know, something's wrong here. So it's more, it's actually my right knee that hurts. No. So, you know, I feel it, it's kind of weird. I feel it in the middle, but I almost feel like maybe kind of moves to the right, to the right of my knee a little bit. So yes, well it's I have probably some fluid. I googled it and you know, it says that sometimes fluid accumulates. Sorry. Well, it did. Like the first time I ran it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it and it went away. But right now, right now, it's not swollen and right now it doesn't hurt, you know? But it just kind of comes on when or you know, right now when I flex and extend my leg it there's no clicking, but I'll notice it in the gym and then you know, when I run it will start hurting. No. No. No, no I don't. Yes. Yes. Well, since you're asking, yes, I, I take ibuprofen and I'll just kind of use it sometime like like sometimes I have some joint issues, but you know, that kind of is not very frequent. So I'll take ibuprofen for that. But you know, it's nothing like major maybe like 400 milligrams Max, something like that. I also sometimes will, you know, smoke a joint. And yeah, other than that. That's it. No. Well, I have sometimes, you know how sometimes, like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kind of, or your legs will swell up. Like I noticed it because of my socks. I'll just kind of notice this invitation. And then another weird thing, I felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes like after the run, there was tingling in my toes like on my, you know, my right toes, so. Yes. No. Well, I don't know if I really tried that, but I, I will tell you that what I noticed is like, if I, you know, when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit. I mean, it's not like major, right? But I, I mean, do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens if it like kind of stays or relax? No, no, nothing like that. No. No, it was just, it was that time, but it was just really weird because it kind of went on for a while. No. No. Well, I had. You know, just kind of your garden variety stuff, right? Colds. And I mean, I, I do have, I'm far sighted. And so I had, I had LASIK surgery and then once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones. And so they had me actually in ER. And if my GP didn't call them, tell them that, you know, they don't need to give me morphine. That was kind of an awful experience, but. Other than that, you know, I'm I'm, I'm pretty good. Well, I'll take, I take vitamin DI, take melatonin sometimes, you know, just for cramps, I'll take like ibuprofen or actually acetamin. I'll take what am I taking? Aleve, Whatever Aleve is. I think that's maybe a certain minothan or I can't remember what class of drugs. You know, occasionally if I'm really having hard times, like I'll I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax. But I prefer melatonin, it's just sometimes melatonin doesn't work. No, no, no problems. Mm-hmm. MMM. I see. OK. Well, you know, I read, I read some stuff online that that maybe like my ligaments there's I think it's like ACL or or something like that, right. And so if that I mean, I'm kind of like freaked out that that may break. So do you think it's that or? OK, right. OK. OK. Can you? So are you going to send referral for that? OK, great. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Yeah, please. Sure. I mean, give me the stronger meds and I'll give that a try. OK, sweet. Thanks so much. Bye, bye.","Hi. Hi Doctor Smith. Yes. My name is Mary Jo.

Um, and, yeah, other than that, that's it. No. Uh, well I have sometimes, you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kinda, or your legs will swell up. Like I noticed it because of my socks, I'll just kind of, notice this indentation. And then, another weird thing. I've felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes, like uh, um, after the run. There was tingling in my toes like on my, you know my right toes, um, so. Yes. No. Well I don't know if I really try that, but I, I will tell you that, what I noticed is like if I, you know when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit, I mean it's not like major, right but, I. Uh, I mean do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens, if it like kind of stays or, . No, no, nothing like that, no. No it was just, it was that time, uh, but it was just really weird, because it kind of went on for a while. No. No. Uh, well, I had uh. You know what just, kind of your garden variety stuff, right, colds and, uh. I mean I, I do have, I'm far-sighted, and so I had uh, I had Lasik surgery. And then, once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones, and so they had me actually in ER. And if my GP didn't call them, tell them, that you know, they don't need to give me Morphine. Um, that was kind of an awful experience but, uh, other than that, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty good. Well, I'll take uh, I take vitamin D. Uh, I take melatonin. Sometimes, you know, just for cramps, I'll take, like, uh, um, ibuprofen, or actually , uh, I'll take, what am I taking? Aleve. Whatever Aleve is. Think that's maybe um, Acetaminophen, or, I can't remember what class of drugs. You know occasionally, if I'm really having hard times, like I'll, I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax. Um, but, I prefer Melatonin, it's just sometimes Melatonin doesn't work. No, no, no problems. Mm-hmm. Hmm. I see. OK. Well, you know I read, I read some stuff online that, that maybe like my ligaments there's, I think it's like ACL or, or something like that right, and so if that. I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that that may break. So do you think it's that, or? Right. OK. OK. Can you, so are you going to send referral for that? OK. Great. Mm-hmm. That sounds good. Thank you yeah. , sure I mean, give me the, stronger medicine, I'll give that a try. OK. Sweet. Thanks so much. OK.

In terms of palpitations, it is most likely to be associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off, and then arranging AGP follow up a week after you've had the test so we can just go through the results with you. So if you call the support line, you can arrange the to have the blood test done. OK. All right, take care. Sorry, wait over.","Hi there. I'm Doctor Smith from Babylon. Hi there.

Sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria, what I would say is probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not sun to ease off. I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment. And we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated. Because if you're if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated. So. Yeah. So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed. You're in an hour ago. So you're obviously still hydrated enough to pass urine. But we we should see you so that we can check your hydration and get that sample sent off as soon as possible.

And if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs like every four hours.

Are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? What can I do for you?  OK, that's fine. So when do you think it started? OK. And any joint problems before that? OK, so at the moment, just tell me about the exercise that you're doing normally.   And have you had any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you? So it means if you're if you're there and you just feel it's sort of jolt like give way, feel unstable underneath you. And does it hurt? How far into the run does it generally hurt? OK, Oh, you're fast. And do you have to stop running or can you run through the pain? OK. OK. Right. And you said before it's both knees. Any problems with your left one? OK. Can you just describe in the knee or show me whereabouts the pain is happening mainly? OK. Have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee? OK, Does it look swollen to you? Does the knee look swollen?  OK. And if you're sitting still for a while, do you have any problems when you stand up and in locking up of the knee? Can't straighten it. Any problems going up and down stairs? Any problems just walking normally? And in terms of range of movement, are you able to fully straighten the leg? And what about fully flex it? OK. Are you taking any medication for the knee?  OK. And any other joint problems that you're getting any back pain, small swelling of your hands, feet, elbows, wrists, any pain? OK. On your right side. Any change in colour or temperature of your lower legs, any swelling which stays if you push in and then you release it that it stays there. OK. Yeah, any or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that. And with your foot, has that gone back to normal now? Do you feel any altered sensation, tingling, numbness, something like that? OK. And any pain in the joints of your foot or on the underside in the arch? Any problems walking around on hard floors? OK. Have you had any other medical problems before?  OK, Do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about?  OK And any problems with your stomach or asthma, indigestion, acid reflux? What I would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using. So as much as you can, because that really does make a difference to injuries, brings the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better. So as much as you can use the ice. Obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon program, but I would try and ease up on the running if you can. And if it, if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running, then it's not a good idea to do that. It's fine to take the ibuprofen. I can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen, but not with the ibuprofen. But make sure that with food. Ultimately, we probably need to examine the knee. So the best thing I would suggest getting an appointment with the physiotherapist first. You can do like a long assessment. And examination of the knee and then make an assessment as to whether we need to do any imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage. It's it's not really possible to diagnose that over the phone over the video. So we definitely would need to see you. The physio is the best point of call because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment, but certainly the appointment times too long to wait then we can see, we can see you as well. Yeah. And we can, we can do the referral for that. If in the meantime you develop like persistent swelling, heat redness of the knee or high temperature, feel unwell or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it, then you'd need to see a doctor urgently. So call us back in that case. OK. I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you. OK, Thank you. Bye.","Hi there. It's Doctor Smith from Babylon. Hi Doctor Smith.
