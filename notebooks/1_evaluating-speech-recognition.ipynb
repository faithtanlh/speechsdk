    "# Evaluating Speech Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we evaluate the speech recognition capabilities of Azure SpeechSDK and Whisper using metrics introduced in `quickstart.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the following 3 key aspects of speech recognition:\n",
    "1. Real-time speech recognition (English)\n",
    "2. Speech diarization\n",
    "3. Multilingual speech recognition (i.e. Mother Tongue languages such as Mandarin, Tamil and Malay) - **KIV (need to check the data)**\n",

    "## Description of Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we will be using is the [National Speech Corpus (NSC)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/national-speech-corpus). \n",
    "\n",
    "### National Speech Corpus (NSC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **National Speech Corpus (NSC)** is a large-scale dataset of Singaporean English speech recordings, developed to support research and development in speech technologies such as speech recognition and synthesis. It was created by Singaporeâ€™s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) in collaboration with research institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key features:\n",
    "- **Diverse Accents**: The corpus includes a wide variety of Singaporean English accents and pronunciations, reflecting the multilingual and multicultural context of Singapore. It also contains multilingual conversation transcriptions, which are useful for diarization & multilingual evaluations.\n",
    "- **Speech Data**: It contains recordings of both read and spontaneous speech, covering various speaking styles and scenarios. We can evaluate the rate at which the speech-to-text system is able to handle context-switching through this dataset.\n",
    "- **Applications**: The NSC is used in developing AI systems for natural language processing, speech-to-text transcription, and improving voice-activated services tailored to local contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It serves as a valuable resource for training speech recognition models, especially those designed for Singapore's linguistic environment.\n"
