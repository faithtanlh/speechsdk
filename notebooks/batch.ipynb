have you had anything like this before in the past   ok   ok did it help   ok ok do you remember the name of the cream you bought   ok steroid **** **** ok   um would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different ok yes no well ok that is so you mentioned the itchiness um you also mentioned it is been quite sore um have you have you noticed any uh bleeding or discharge from your skins   ok you have not    have not uh seen any other uh pus or blood coming out of your skin no and you mentioned it all started three days ago are you four days ago are you aware of any triggers or anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start so for example have you changed your uh shower gel any clothing have you been around anyone else mm mm no no   ok that is   ok um fine so just to resummarize for the last four days you have had very itchy skin very sore skin all over your body mainly your chest and did you also mention your arms and legs as well **** ** ****   ok anything on your face at all on your face no   ok and apart from this any other symptoms have you noticed for example have you noticed any temperature or fevers   itchy   ok so your your bowels are working   ok your chest is ok no cough no breathing difficulties you are passing urine ok ok alright    um it is always good to know so i mean do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms   ok that is   ok so um normally at this stage i like to examine you um to see the rash itself  to see exactly what type of rash it is but from what you have told me you mentioned it is you have got some dry skin and some uh cracked skin as well  uh and has been very itchy and so would your um uh your your background of eczema um so sorry to say there is a couple of questions i wanted to ask you which i completely forgot my apologies um apart from the eczema do you have any other medical problems i should be aware of   ok not *** anymore   ok and do you take any regular medications at the moment no   ok do you have any allergies to anything sorry i *** ***** ** said do you have any allergies to anything hello ** can you hear me  that is alright i think it      uh do you have any allergies at all no ok um and tell me about your um uh your situation at home who do you live with ok and what do you do for work ok uh no no no that is that is absolutely fine um just a couple of questions i   want to ask you which can sometimes affect your symptoms is do you smoke at all no and do you drink much in the way of alcohol ok ok ok i have got to say at this stage i have got to say this sound quality is not uh great but i will continue because we have come this far um so um based on everything you mentioned sarah i do wonder whether this is a ***** flareup of your eczema um the reason being that you said it was quite itchy um it is mainly affecting your chest and your back um and uh having looked at your skin uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar ***        um you mentioned using steroid creams yesterday um from the pharmacy i wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial uh which i am happy to prescribe to you today as well as **** i am going to give you something some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin ***** ***   um which use in the bath and shower and it is definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days uh before we make the decision on whether it is working or not um it is also worth um using antihistamines which you can sometimes buy over *** counter things like loratadine or piriton which can help **** the itchiness of your skin and uh um it is also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap because if that is causing your symptoms then we need to have a discussion about ** **** **** an eczema  cu ohh could you say that again sorry **** * ** ***   ok   ok so it is something for you to think about you can get different types of antihistamines i can give you something a little bit stronger today as well um something like fexofenadine which i can give to you today it is definitely worth trying and it is not going to do you any harm um but i ********* think using the steroids and the emollients um on a regular basis uh over the next week to ten days should hopefully control your symptoms but do come back and see me next week if things do not get better   ok um do you have **** any questions for me   ok well i wish you all the best thank you have a good day\n",

      "REF: hello hello there it is uh doctor here how can i help you this afternoon i am sorry to hear that um can you tell me a bit more about the headache mmhmm mm ok and well let us try our best let us try and get you let us try and get you well soon um you mentioned   it is on your     left hand side is that right and it started at midday a few hours ago   ok um did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more of a gradual   build   up ok and are you able to describe what kind of headache it was for example was it throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain and is it moving anywhere else at all   uh ok is that when you move your neck   ok   um ok is that  all you are worried about is that   is that all your main worries today oh dear i am sorry to hear that i can i can understand why it is affecting you um but why do not we why do not we take a good history first and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what is going on here um so you mentioned a few things you mentioned         a headache you also mentioned some disease  like lyme is uh before the headaches came on and your vision has been blurry as well is that right is that is that on both eyes or just in left left eye both eyes   ok have you *** any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all ohh i see   ok um and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous have you vomited at all ** *** ***** twice  ok   um earlier today   ok um any temperatures or fevers   ok um any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed   ok um fine um and do you normally get headaches   ok and what happened then how long did it last for did you do anything that made it better yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure i mean i can see your  concern obviously is a lot there is a lot of worry there um but you know let let let as i said let us take it       step  by step um to see exactly what the  cause of these headaches are first um i am just going to ask you some um very uh yes no questions if that is   ok maam um um have you noticed any problems with your speech at all any difficulties with your words any problems with your arms and legs for example numbness or weakness *** any difficulty with balance your balance or coordination   ok and have you had any injuries to your head have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head   ok alright    um and and you are feeling otherwise   ok so for example your um uh your your breathing is   ok you are not feeling breathless or no   ok um do you have any other medical history i should be aware of no so for example have you had has anyone told you you have had migraines in the past no   ok    do you ok right my next question was  that of family history is there anything in the family so apart from migraines is there anything else is there anything related to *** brain for example what was that sorry ********** thyroid as well   ok   um ok any other problems with for example the brain or um you mentioned brain cancer any other family history of **** no   ok um in terms of medications do you take anything on a regular basis   ok and how long have you been on that for three months   ok and is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else ****  ok alright that is something ** you meant to have a little discussion about today as well um uh well my next question was about um your social ****** your situation at home you mentioned you work in the fashion industry and your work is your job quite stressful at the moment have you been is it getting you down ****  ok alright and what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally   ok do you do much in the way of exercise   no ok um who is at home with you   ok um are you coping   ok at the moment yeah   ok um do you smoke at all *** and do you drink much in the way of alcohol   ok alright    um so normally at this i would like to kind of proceed to examination  um that is um based on your story um i wonder whether you may uh may have a migraine uh migraine type headache uh it sounds um very classical of that of that nature the the the headache on one side throbbing nature the nausea vomiting um sensitivity to bright lights uh i am reassured that you do not have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer i know that was a big worry of yours initially um yeah yeah well i hope that puts your you know **** mind at ease um certainly this is the second migraine you have had in the space of a month um so i think moving forwards there is a couple of options i think keeping a headache diary would be quite important uh to see exactly what is triggering these headaches and in  terms   of trying  to treat your headaches today *** some strong painkillers would be advisable so *** **** think about paracetamol or even cocodamol um and some antiinflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen how is that sound to you um and uh you know if your headaches were to become more persistent then we could maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place something *** **** prophylactic medicines then we could have a discussion next time i **** see you next week perhaps   ok um now a couple of things i want you to think about is you know if your symptoms are not getting better ** *** next two three days or indeed they are getting worse i would like you to come back and see me um straight away if possible so if your headache is getting worse not responding to medications or your um neck pain is getting worse or you *** develop any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision then i want you to come back and see me straight away ****   ok does that sound all   ok great any questions for me   ok have a good

exactly   ok did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual   ok   ok and can you describe the pain to me   just in just below your belly button you ****  uh mentioned   ok um and is the pain constant or does it come and go mmhmm ok um and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms at all so for example let us let us focus first on your bowels are your bowels working   ok   ok so you have got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools   no ok and what about your waterworks are you passing urine   ok   mm and when you mentioned pink urine do you was there any blood at all in your urine or was it difficult to say ****  ok alright but otherwise it does not hurt uh or or or sting when you pass urine   ok   ok um ok and um moving on      to other symptoms have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all no ***** vomiting any temperatures or fevers   ok fine  um  uh uh and  kim  have to ask um uh all    all all patients this ** this question is about your cycle if you do not mind me asking um are you currently um are you currently sexually active   ok so you have had no other  partner since then   ok um uh and do you use any contraception at all        at  the moment ok fine um are you still having periods when was your last period two  week scare   ok so is there any chance you could be pregnant i know you have got an implement in there but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant it is something for us to think about        yeah   ok well it is something for us to think about ***** um   uh maybe worth taking a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that   um ok and and so just to summarize so far if you do not mind it is really for the last couple of days   it is tummy pain that is really affected you mainly lower down towards your belly button it is quite burning you said it is getting worse um you noticed some pink urine um but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine your bowels are working   ok you have felt a little bit nauseous um and feeling hot and sweaty have i got that all right is there anything else perhaps that you feel like you should share with me at this stage ***** anything  that might be important yeah   ok um tell me tell me a bit more about your um medical history otherwise are you normally fit and well   ok um have you had anything like this before in the past any similar symptoms no   ok um fine um any other family history i should be aware of anything relevant family uh related to bowels maybe related to ***** history   ok alright    um and socially just tell me a bit more about your home situation who is at home with you   ok um and uh are you currently working what do you do for work   ok um ok um do you smoke at all kim no and do you drink much in the way of alcohol no   ok   ok um just before i go to the examination i just want to go through just some few screening questions if that is   ok yes or no uh we have we have covered the majority of them already uh but i just want to make sure i am not missing anything else um how is your how is your chest how is your breathing   um any ok any uh funny heartbeats or rhythms palpitations   ok any headaches any *** problems with your vision no   ok alright    um fine   ok um so really just uh moving on um and so based based on your story really uh uh kim it is it is it is difficult  it is it is um you know you have got some   tummy pain you do not exactly know what is causing it it could be a few different things that could be causing your pain could just be a you know could just be a urine infection for example ** could just be something related to your gut um could just be something related to your you know a ********* pregnancyrelated cause um and so it is probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out um what is going on here um which i can organize for you today  um   and basically those tests we we will have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed but certainly it if it is been going on for the last couple of days um uh you know it is probably maybe worth empirically treating you for  a maybe * urine infection and so   it   is          an yeah absolutely so um i think it is certainly worth you know covering you with some antibiotics today uh but i still want you to bear in mind you know   have a pregnancy test done to make sure we are not missing anything else here and um and i want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if they are getting worse so things to look out for would be you know ***** worsening tummy pain um if you are feeling really hot  or sweaty your temperature is not coming down um vomiting  et cetera does that make sense   ok um you can try just regular painkillers uh paracetamol would be advisable um make sure you drink plenty of fluids you can try some cranberry juice as well which uh can sometimes help with your urine symptoms um take the antibiotics uh and give me a call you know if you are worried about anything else yeah if    i send it straight to your pharmacy start the antibiotics today something called trimethoprim         um you  can take two tablets uh one tablet twice a day for three days uh let us see how you get on great all the best bye bye\n",

you say a small heart attack did they give you a name for what happened a a name of a diagnosis it is more hard to say   ok was it like angina or   um   ok   ok ok you have been   ok since then ****  ok alright so apart from the uh the heart the heart problems the heart failure any other problems i should be aware of   ok um do you take any regular medications apart from your *** diuretics that you are taking and do you know which ones do you know which dose you are taking   that is ok no problems um any other medications   ok the metoprolol was it or sorry the connection is not very good   ok thank you yeah   and    a thousand    ok alright any allergies at all any medications no   ok and is there anything in the family that is uh that that is uh that is important for me to know any family history of medical problems heart problems lung problems i am sorry to hear that and um how old was your father when he passed away ** early sixties ok alright anything else i should be aware of   ok is your mother still with us   ok alright um and socially sir just tell me a bit more about your situation at home who lives at home with you you have got two cats   ok great do they have

a lot of night driving weekend driving ****   ok  ok alright and what about smoking and alcohol      so cause that can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems do you do you smoke at all so you used to smoke and how many did you smoke a day on average um and how many how many years was that for   ok  and what about the stopping that must have been **** difficult for you **** **** *** stopping um and what what about alcohol ok do you do much in the way of exercise sir   ok   ok right   ok and certainly now **** your symptoms you you are you said you are feeling more breathless even walking to the uh to the shop she said um right ohh um based on your based on you history and having listened to your story i i wonder whether you have had a *** ** * flareup of your heart failure sir um which can sometimes happen  um  um  and uh it is so it seems like your heart is not pumping as well as it should be um and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure there is obviously um that is the first thing that comes to my mind um now there is a couple of options ** move forward um given that you are otherwise well at the moment and having examined you your chest and your saturations and blood pressure are all   ok i am quite happy to increase your dose of furosemide maybe rather than one tablet a day we can ****  do two tablets a day for the first few days um and see and see how you are getting on uh i think i think it is it is it is definitely worth treating your symptoms but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart is pumping is that something you have had before yeah so um an   it   is a it is a general scan of your heart you might have had this done before when you were diagnosed and it is just to get a good sorry  you remember that ok fine that is something i can organize for you today and and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized but i think certainly in the meantime let us um let us let us get a blood test done we can check your um you know your full blood count look for signs of anemia we can have a check of your kidney function um and we can definitely increase your     um  your furosemide uh to you know one tablet twice a day but i really like would like you to come back and see me in about a week is time ** see how you are getting on **** that sound reasonable and of course in the meantime if you are getting more unwell feel like you are getting more breathless or you are having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness then uh you know **** i want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well   ok do you have any questions for

experiencing ok and and uh the pain in your tummy is it can you describe the the pain to me is it cramping burning sharp right right   ok ok um fine and have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal no   ok fine have you noticed any any funny colour to your urine  so has there been uh any blood in your urine ** have you noticed any other darkening of *** urine  yes   ok fine   ok um right let me just write a few notes down as well   um and you mentioned   a tummy pain that also started a few days ago does the pain move anywhere else does it move towards the back or towards your flank the sides no   ok fine **** with those symptoms have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea vomiting   ok any fevers or temperatures sorry was there any any fevers or temperatures sorry i did not hear you no fever   ok fine sorry   um ok um in terms of your bowel are your bowels working   ok so uh by that i mean um any      any diarrhoea loose stool   ok all right and um jessica sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions uh just to get a full history um hope you do not mind me asking but are you currently sexually active   ok is that with a regular partner fine   ok  um have you noticed any other discharge from from down below no   ok when was your last um uh last std screen if if ever   no ok fine and and um do you use any form of contraception at all you use condoms   ok and when was your last period three weeks ago ok is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps is there any chance you could be pregnant no no it is always worth asking uh young females like yourself um uh um so if that obviously ** you are worried about the pain um not getting any better uh then i would always advise *** getting a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy   ok um fine so just moving on moving on are you otherwise     fit and well and so by that i mean do you have any other medical problems medical medical history   ok do you take any regular medications   ok so you have tried that and it did not help   ok all right um do you have any allergies to any medications and what happens when you take clindamycin right then ok so it is quite a seems like a quite severe allergy to it is is that right   um ok fine in terms of your family history is there anything i should be aware of um related to kidneys bladder bowels guts   ok     all right and tell me a bit more about your home situation who is lives who is at home with you ok and what ok and are you a are you working at the moment or are you a student ok and what are you studying and how is that going great do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers * recommend it we need doctors um what about smoking and alcohol do you drink much in the way of do you do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol so socially   ok all right um right excellent so um at this stage i    i would proceed to examination but um based on your story um just to summarise really so *** last three days you have been having * bit of burning pain on ***** ** passing urine a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down um essentially but but no other fevers or back pain uh if i if i understand correctly i think *** probably do have what we call a simple uti or * urinary tract infection ** bladder infection um which can be readily treated so i will give you a course of antibiotics today something called either nitrofurantoin or  trimethoprim uh and it is normally a    three day course uh so one tablet twice a day for three days and that should hopefully help your symptoms but i also advise you to drink plenty   of fluids let us try and flush that you know that infection out of your body if you can um you can try cranberry juice that can sometimes help with your symptoms um and if you are still not better by the end of this week i want you to give me a call or come back and see me and uh we can have another look at your symptoms   ok yeah yeah absolutely and things to look out for would be you know if you are having kind of high temperatures a back pain um just generally feeling more unwell uh you know i do want you give me a call back   cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys which is something we **** wanna avoid so do do give me a call if you  are having any concerns   ok yeah i mean if you can try and avoid it i think that would be sensible um uh it is great that you are using barrier contraception i would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up that would probably be the best for you and your boyfriend     all right great   thank you very much wish you all the best\n",

afternoon right ok i am    sorry to hear there is a lot going on there and i can see why it is affecting you um so you mentioned it is been going on for *** last three days mainly the burning pain when you pass urine um you said you are going to the toilet more often as well that right ohh and   a week sorry   my ok uh are you noticing      any anything in your urine *** ******* predominantly blood or um discolouration of urine   ok uh of any kind of frank blood i mean red blood at all in your urine   ok um fine we will we will have to definitely explore that in a little bit   or detail later on um you also mentioned some tummy pain as well can you tell me a bit more about that pain   ok um can you describe ** it crampy pain is it more of a burning pain ok an aching pain ok and does the pain move anywhere else does it move towards your back towards your sides   ok all right um any other symptoms *** ******* nausea vomiting ok any temperatures or fevers   ok all right and how are your bowels at the moment are your bowels working   ok   ok and when when when you say you have problems what kind of problems do you normally have right ok all right but   and you have noticed no new symptoms no no no new symptoms in your bowels uh ok all right um and amanda sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine um uh can i ask are you currently uh are you currently sexually active at the moment   ok and um have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from from the front passage ok have you do you use any form of contraception the pill what kind of pill is it is it * combined pill or the **** minipill   ok fine   um when was the last time you had um unprotected sex if you do not want me asking yeah exactly yep a week ago ok all right what i am trying ** get at is whether um uh there is any chance you could be pregnant at all uh i know you are on the pill but um we are we nonetheless we do have to ask um when was your last when was your last period two weeks ago   ok all right just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms do not get any better   ok um fine in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you uh eating and drinking   ok sure well thanks for sharing with me um so i i do not think it is is related to your symptoms i think it ** probably just pure pure coincidence um but uh you know i do strongly advise you to you know um make it a regular habit if you can um just for your just for your general health moving forwards   ok um fine moving on in terms of your health otherwise do you have any other medical conditions apart from the ibs is there anything else i should be aware of no   ok great and ****  what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the um combined pill was      it yeah   ok   ok and   is  that for the cramps the crampy pain yeah   ok and do you have any   allergy to any medications *******   ok   ok   ok   ritib   ok sure i will make a note of that um in terms of family history any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys   no or ** generally anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who is at home with you very good great and what are you studying at university english   ok good and how are you enjoying your course good very good very good good um in terms of smoking and alcohol do you do you participate in either o k ok what what is made you have your first joint last week was ok sure uh and obviously as your doctor  i  am  here to look after you so yeah i i would strongly recommend you you know to avoid if you can great um fine so at this stage i would not normally examine you but i think based on your story i think um you know uh i am reassured but the fact that i i i think it is um probably just a simple what we would say a uti or a cystitis bladder infection uh you know you have not got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there is anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain um would be more worrying for me to hear um so it is something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics um so we have got a choice of two antibiotics something called  trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin which is a    three day course and normally they are usually quite effective um for your symptoms it is probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what is going on there um start the antibiotics make sure you are well hydrated drink plenty of fluids um if you are having some pain simple paracetamol um would probably be advisable um we will see what the urine sample shows um and if it is indeed positive we will know which antibiotics are the right ones um but if things still are still not getting any better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again so if i will give *** yeah no ****   it is a well uh so yeah good question so i will give you i will organise uh for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices um which we can test there and then ******* ***  at the urine and send it off to the lab  uh we can ****** *** back in touch with you with the results   ok do bear in mind those symptoms i mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting if you have any of those give me a call   ok  all right ok have a good day thank you

symptoms ** ** ** *** ******** in your bowels ** ** all right ** and amanda sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine ** ** can i ask are you currently ** *** *** ********* sexually active ** *** moment okay and ** have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from **** the front passage ** **** *** do you use any form of contraception *** **** what kind of pill is it is it a combined pill or the mini     pill okay fine fine when was the last time you had ** unprotected sex if you do not mind me asking yeah exactly *** * **** *** ** *** ***** what i am trying to get at is whether ** ** there is any chance you could be pregnant at all ** i know you are on the pill but ** ** *** ** nonetheless we do have to ask ** when was your last **** *** **** **** period two weeks ago okay all right just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms do not *** *** better okay ** fine in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you ** eating and drinking okay sure well thanks for sharing with me ** so i * do not think it is ** related to your symptoms i think it is probably just pure **** coincidence ** but ** you know i do strongly advise you to you know ** make it a regular habit if you can ** just for your **** *** **** general health moving forwards okay ** **** moving on in terms of your health otherwise do you have any other medical conditions apart from *** ibs is there anything else i should be aware of no okay great and will there    be any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the ** combined pill the bedroom yeah okay okay and then after *** the cramps the crampy pain yeah okay *** do you have any allergies to any medications writing okay okay okay writing okay sure i will make a note of that ** in terms of family history any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys nope or no     jenny anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who is at home with you very good great and what are you studying at university english okay good and how *** you enjoying your course **** very good very good good ** in terms of smoking and alcohol do you ** *** participate ** either * * ** what **** ** made you have your first joint last week *** ** sure ** and obviously as your doctor is out there to look after you so **** i * would strongly recommend you you know to avoid if you can great ** fine so as    i  said i would not normally examine you but i think based on your story i think ** you know ** i am reassured  by the fact that i * * think it is ** probably just a simple what we ***** say * uti or a cystitis bladder infection ** you know you have not got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there is anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain ** would be more worrying for me to hear ** so ** ** something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics ** so we have got a choice of two antibiotics something called trimethoprine or nitrofurantoin which is a threeday *** course *** normally they are usually quite effective ** for your symptoms it is probably worth giving us a urine sample ***** as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what is going on there ** start the antibiotics make sure you are well hydrated drink plenty of fluids ** if you are having some pain simple paracetamol ** would probably be advisable ** we will see what the urine sample shows ** and if it is indeed positive we will know which antibiotics are the right ones ** but if things ***** are still not getting any better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again so ** i will give you yeah no well that is a **** ** ** **** good question so i will give you i will organise ** for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices ** which we can test there and then whether you are  in depth and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results okay do bear in mind those symptoms i mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting if you have any of those give me a call okay okay ***** ** have a good day thank you

basically i think it is  diarrhea and it is like just coming out like loads of it like i go to the toilet and it is just super watery and it yeah it does not feel very solid ** so it **** ** is just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it is ** yeah it is just ** not being **** very pleasant and like i just it just kind of has not it does not feel like it is getting better so ** so i think it was a few when i think about it so monday tuesday i saw ** i think it was about three it is been about three days now ** so i * feel like it is like almost every hour when i am awake ** ** sorry yeah so i mean i am * ** trying to drink a lot of water but ** yeah it is just quite a lot and ** ** ** yeah i * * think i * feel like it is just **** fluids coming out ** so * no i do not * ** *** remember anything like no i * think it is just * nothing like that there is nothing **** **** yeah i mean i ** * feel * **** a cramp and then *** **** i know it is time to go right so around every hour i just feel something come up and then i have to go so yeah i mean that is **** ** the kind of *** first sign it is kind of if i think about it it is like ** ** **** at the bottom ** i do not know if that makes sense ** ** i * think it ** ** feels pretty like in the middle to me not on any side left to right ** it ** comes and goes it comes and goes okay so like ** so what do you mean by ** pain so i * think it is maybe * i * guess so * ** when i think about it like when i get it i can pretend that i do not feel it so i can still sit down and ** i can still like cover it up and people do not really notice so i * do not know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven ** um yeah i definitely i definitely feel kind of nauseous um like i and like i have have vomited *** when i like i think it is maybe something to do with like whenever i have like milk or something like that i just feel like i want to vomit and actually like yeah one time i just like had some milk and i just completely vomited it ** i have been * **** **** trying to avoid it but ** yeah ** sorry could you repeat that oh no no it is not ** so * yeah i think i am pretty i feel kind of really hot all the time and ** i am pretty sure i am burning up i have not actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but ** ** * yeah i   am * **** sure i am * ** not a **** *** * normal temperature ** yeah but *** i guess less frequently maybe ** but yeah it seems to be ok um so i know so my um my brother has had actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days as well um and i i **** i am not yeah i * can not think of what what the trigger is for me i mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but yeah * that is why ** ** so he is been like this for five days i think he is getting better but i am not * ** *** really sure he said he **** ** *** ** is had something for a little while as well ** so it just feels like the *** fluids do go down but it just feels like it is going straight through ** just feels like it is going straight through ** so i had some i mean i had some lunch today ** but again it just ** **** came **** out pretty loose um so i um yeah i think i think otherwise i am fit and well i um yeah i mean i * am an okay weight and um i * can not think of any related medical history um i mean like my

afternoon ohh dear   ok when when did it exactly start this headache three days ago   ok and ***** whereabout in your head is this pain ok   um and is the headache there all the time or does it come and go   ok so it comes and fine   ok and if i was to ask you on a scale of one to ten um ten being the worst type of pain you **** ever had how would you rate this headache eight and if i was to ask you ** describe the headache to me um in terms of the nature of the pain is it sharp is it dull is it crampy is it throbbing mmhmm mmhmm so you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days   ok have you tried anything which has made the headache better  did that help   ok all right and except for the headaches any other symptoms at all so *** example any problems **** your eyesight or your vision so when you say annoying does it hurt to look uh look at bright lights   ok and um have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision mmm ok any nausea or any vomiting when you say sick you mean you feel sick   ok yeah no vomiting   ok any neck pain or neck stiffness   ok and any difficulty with speaking or um speech any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs ohh really   ok   ok yeah probably well i will i will ask you a bit more about your work later on um any recent head injuries at all   ok and have you had anything like this before in the past or uh or similar similar to similar to this kind of headache not ok all right um any temperatures or fevers any rashes at all on your skin   ok and just moving forwards are you otherwise fit and well adriana *** you fit and well do you have any other medical history any history of migraines at all   ok um fine i will ask you a bit more about that in just a second before i go any further can i ask do you take any regular medication are you on the pill   ok do you have any allergies to any medications   ok so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines are they is that normally wellcontrolled or are they um having difficulty controlling their symptoms mmhmm ok ohh right ok fine um socially tell me a bit more about your life outside of um outside of work so who lives at home with you *****  ok excellent and are you working at the moment you mentioned this impacting on your work mmm ok do you wear glasses have you had any uh have you had any recent eye check done eye test   ok all right something  for  you to bear in mind if you feel that you are your eyes are straining um i would always recommend having a repeat eye test done um have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently   ok all right great um regarding smoking or alcohol do you drink or smoke at all but only socially   ok right now um adriana do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms have you have you read anything online or spoken to people mmhmm mmm ok is    it anything in particular you were hoping i could do for you today ok how many tablets did you take of ibuprofen three a day ok all right um so uh adriana so um really what i think is going on here i uh unfortunately i do think this could be a headache very similar to a migraine um the reason i say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mum and your sister also **** migraines i think it is something for us to think about um now i am not saying it is ***** gonna keep happening but it may just be a oneoff but it is certainly worth treating it today **** **** stronger analgesia or painkillers um now moving forward we have some options which we can discuss uh you tried the ibuprofen now my only worry is i am not sure whether you are taking the correct dose you can take up to two tablets three times a day so so there is definitely room for improvement there or i can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen which is another antiinflammatory which can be helpful um we can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine which might be helpful as well   ok and i think it is certainly worth looking into that so i can give you a prescription for that today um with regards to um the next few days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what is you know if there is any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse and and you know i would like you to come back and see me in about uh a week is time week to two weeks time if you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis but we can have that discussion next time   ok in the meantime if your headaches are not getting any better or they are getting worse um you know i want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner   ok so if you  are having any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you are just not feeling very well just give me a call and come back and see me all right great ** well have a good day   bye\n",

mentioned a couple of things there you mentioned a cough you mentioned a bit of a runny nose is that right   ok let us focus on your cough first can you tell me a bit more about your cough   ok so it is a dry cough so you are not bringing up any you are not bringing up any **** mucky ohh i can hear that yeah  um you are not bringing up any uh mucky phlegm or anything like that no   ok so it keeps you up at night  um you mentioned uh the cold symptoms as well the runny nose    do   you have a do you have a sore throat at all *** right do you have any uh how are your ears do  you ears feel blocked or no pain no discharge coming from your ears   ok alright    um fine in terms of your breathing how is your how is your chest is your breathing more labored      day to day when you walk around uh you do not feel breathless do you **   ok   ok any pain in your chest   ok you mentioned feeling tired um have you felt feverish at all have you had a temperature **** **** *** ***** **** **** **** ok   ok   ok   ok alright    um fine and in terms of any other symptoms so have you had any nausea have you had any vomiting ok how is your appetite   ok has that got better now the  diarrhea   ok fine um any problems with your waterworks at all uh your your waterworks your urine you are passing urine   ok you are drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine   ok   ok alright    um in terms of any other  thing do you notice any any  find any skin rashes or um problems with your muscles or joints yeah ok right right ok ok i am sorry that must be very difficult for you *** **** **** quite lethargic and weak you mentioned um ok and um april are you normally otherwise fit and well uh fit and well so do you have any other medical history   ok   ok and what do you take for your blood pressure any  or what what medications do you take on a regular basis if you do not mind saying yep zinopril ok fine any allergies at all to medications no   ok regarding any family history is there anything i should be aware of ****  ok alright who is looking after your diabetes is there anyone **  is there a doctor in a hospital   who looks after your diabetes right excellent and in terms of your social situation who lives at home with you lives ok um fine is your partner well at the moment *** right   ok  so  he  go away he is got away with it at the moment   ok and uh are you working at the moment april yeah no i can imagine what is it that you do for work ohh  so you work in the it field ok it field right ok uh no has it been quite stressful recently ok the reason i ask is sometimes sure reason i ask is because sometimes stress can really affect your immune system um but uh it is good to know you are you are you are not feeling stressed um do you smoke at all april   ok um and what about alcohol and what is it that you drink the wine *** how much  do you drink on those nights   ok so um yeah so you are probably just about under the limit of um the recommended limit something ** **** ** think about just      in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can really ideally the the the right answer is to cut down completely but so in practice i know that is not realistic so maybe for the first few weeks why do not you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter um and if you are coping   ok then you can maybe try and cut down altogether   ok just something for you to think about um right so uh just as we wrap up really um april i think based on your story i think uh essentially i think you are you are going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness um i do not think there is anything to worry about you know you have had a bit of a cough bit of a runny nose feeling quite weak and lethargic i am hoping that you know you are probably over the worst of it now it is been five days i am hoping you are maybe going to get better in the next couple of days it normally lasts for about a week to ten days yeah absolutely so you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to you know get some nice good rest drink plenty of fluids keep yourself **** wellhydrated you can take * regular paracetamol if you feel like you are still not getting any better in two to three days it is probably worth coming back to see me again we can check you over and if you are still feeling feverish um and your cough is not getting any better then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest  some  of       the uh uh common source of infection um yeah so i think you know really i * think it depends on you it is um if you are coughing then there is a theoretical you know risk that you are maybe slightly infectious still so i would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can uh and get some good bed rest um and maybe think about work early next week but um if your cough is not getting any better or your breathing is getting worse i want you to come back and see me sooner   ok no no no nothing to worry about otherwise   ok  well have a good day appreciate it\n",

      "REF: hi there good morning um i am doctor deen mirza from   gp at hand nice to see you   ok before we start your appointment could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth   ok that is great thank you for that um are you in a private * place where you are   ok to speak freely   ok ok great   ok so um tell me a bit about what is been happening you said you mentioned in the notes that you have got a problem with your elbow sure sure sure and and so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow left elbow **** *****   ok and have you banged that elbow  do you have any kind of injury sure   ok and um in terms of your job do you do anything physical right   ok and um has this happened before sure   ok uh and can i   um    can     i just doublecheck has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that   ok sure so you know you said you think you have got uh osteoarthritis has anyone ever told you that have you ever seen a doctor who is confirmed that and told you you have got osteoarthritis   ok was that a gp or a specialist or was it a physiotherapist gp   ok all right    um look can i just     uh sorry can i just doublecheck how old you are please fifty three ok fantastic all right um and do you have any other illnesses at all right ok ok uh are you are are you allergic to any medication no sure and um do you um are you on any medication on a regular basis no   ok and are you normally fit and well mobile and active   ok good good glad to hear well done that is it is good that you are doing that on a regular basis ok um and um uh can i is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now   ok good bear with me one second right   ok and if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so i can just see the underside   ok fantastic all right and then just bring it  round to this side i can see *** other side   ok fantastic all right and if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers there is is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin it is a bit warmer   ok um and um is it very tender when you are pressing on that nerve is it if you if you give it a press does it hurt you at all   ok all right um well um i noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow do you do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body do you do you suffer from eczema at all no *** alright   ok so um what i think we should do with regards to your elbow problem   ok is um i think it would be worthwhile this seems like uh what we call the bursitis   ok so that is an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint um what i think we should do is i think you should be on some antiinflammatory medication in the in the first instance and as well as that what i would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of uh causes of joint swelling    k so um what we are going to do is we are going to arrange some um blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there will be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done and that will involve you um having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers infection rheumatological antibodies so we will do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well   ok um the time frame for that will be um the results will come back to us after about five or six days um from now but it   may take time for the  form to come out to you and if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away by the time that we are expecting * result back you know one or two days after that we are looking ** maybe six days and what i would suggest is we can arrange a followup appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint feel it we can review the blood  test  uh we can um get a gauge as to uh what is going on now in terms of your joint right now it does not look like to me that is something called excuse me septic arthritis so we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint um and uh your your joint does not look like that however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful uh and the redness was to spread or become uh you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible   cause that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment   ok no i i do not think this is anything dangerous do not need to worry   ok what i am doing is i am just outlining the     worst case scenario if things were to to develop    k so ** ****** **** **   this this is not the case right now right now it looks quite straightforward it is nothing sinister or lifethreatening um what i am doing is i am just saying in case things worsen these are the things that we would be looking out for and this is what  we have to do but you do not have that now thankfully and i do not think you are going to have it but i am just saying the   what if scenario is that   ok all right did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me   ok all right   um ok so i i would take ibuprofen regularly   ok you can get that over the counter um that is four hundred milligrams two times a day and you should take take that after food not on an empty stomach if you get any heartburn stop taking it   ok     all right so what i **** wanna do is i will get the forms sent out to you and um we are going to arrange a a followup appointment maybe within a um actually you know the followup appointment does not have to be facetoface if it is more convenient for you do ** to do it over the phone we can do that over the phone uh over video  we can do that as well that is that is your call but you contact us after you have had the blood test done ** and we can review things then   ok sure sure that is a good idea all right then   ok um take care then so look just leave that with me i will sort all those bits and pieces out and then we will get them sent out to you and then we will we will um review you after the **** tests things goes well   ok all right then take care then all the best    bye bye\n",

wanting to exercise and couple of weeks   ok and then and the last day or so that is when you get the cough and the pain in the side and you have ******* cough blood   ok all right um you said you felt a bit warm have you measured your temperature at all *** ** just ***** *** with that   ok fair enough all right   um ok and now can i just ask um do you smoke at all ok what do you work as   ok     all right and um do you live alone yeah in a flat or a house   ok do you have any pets a cat   ok um uh uh are you on any medication at all regular medication methotrexate   ok what are you on that for sle   ok do you have any other diagnoses any other illnesses at all right   ok um and do you have any allergies to any medication any other allergies at all   ok so um you are on you are taking methotrexate at the moment when was the last time you had methotrexate ohh you had it this morning   ok ohh right all right   ok um um couple of things i would like to do in order to try and um get an idea of how unwell you are   ok um the first thing i would like to do is to try and measure your pulse so what the way we are ***** gonna do this is that if you are if i can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist not everyone can do this so do not worry if you can not but if you if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse it is just under the thumb if you put  two fingers up and down like that you might be able to feel the pulse you **** got it   ok are you sure     all right so what i am going to do is i am going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting   ok so i will just get my stopwatch up   ok so if you can um you have still got the pulse   ok so if you can start counting now please if you can stop now that i think that was about eleven or twelve um so that would make your heart rate about sixty six to seventy four that is that is ok good fantastic and the next thing i would like you to try and do   ok um it depends on the lighting so it may not be possible but the next thing i would like you to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger and then let me see how quickly the redness  come back   ok so if you can see what i am doing now my  finger   is come right behind the screen i am squeezing it   ok just watch me first it is all right just watch me first yeah i am i am squeezing it and then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour   ok so if i can get you just to put your finger up to the your camera and then with the other hand just try and squeeze it and see **** ** ***** ****   ok perfect that is great thank you so much the last thing i would like to do is i would like to try and have a look down your throat   ok are are you doing this consultation via um a phone or a laptop a phone sorry say that again ****   ok   ok so if you if you um position your device up above your head put your head back mouth open wide and let me see if i can have    a that is **** fantastic and say ah perfect thank you for that excellent   ok last thing is if i can get you to feel inside your neck just on the sides here   ok um by your adam is apple tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not   ok all right um now um uh sorry i have forgotten your name doris ok doris um so so doris um what what i think we need to do is um this sounds like you might have a chest infection   ok if you are coughing up blood and you are feeling your heart racing um uh i think you need to be examined today someone needs to listen to your chest and um maybe check your blood pressure as well check that you are stable i have to say examining you now from what limited examination i could do online you are everything does seem to be   ok in terms of you you do not seem acutely unstable however if you have got this kind of pain um when taking a deep breath in and you are coughing up blood we do do we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a pneumonia or chest infection and um that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope and you may need um an antibiotic   uh there is one thing i need to ask you have you been on any longhaul flight recently no   ok have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your lung blood clots no   ok anyone in the family have that no   ok all right um what i think we will do is um we will arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today   ok um i would like someone to listen to your chest and ** check your blood pressure and to to recheck your pulse as well just make sure and check your temperature make sure all those parameters are   ok you may well need an antibiotic   ok um do you have any allergies to any antibiotics no   ok um i i am not i am gonna not i am not going to prescribe anything for you now because i think you need to have that basic assessment first um before we proceed to the next step but the that is what i would predict the next step might be um i am going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team and then they will book you in for a facetoface appointment with one of our gps today and then they will do that assessment and then we will take it from there   ok um uh given the the way in which you uh have presented now just one day with a fever and this slight pain concurrent with the the blood  in the    the the flem that is not usually how lung cancer is presented it is more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms um however we might need to get some investigations to exclude that it depends on the examination finding when   we see you all right are you worried about lung cancer sure of course yeah so just remind me how old you are again i am sorry forty five ok it is something we do need to be cognisant of   ok um and we may end up having to do a followup chest xray if things do not settle down but at the moment it it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer yeah that that is good to know yeah      so that is cause that is easier to treat but we still need to make sure that things are   ok because chest infections can become nasty as well it can lead to infection inside the body we want to avoid that as well so let us get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment all right you are welcome all right take care then all the best bye\n",

      "REF: hi there i am doctor deen mirza from babylon good morning good morning sorry before we start could i get your full name and date of birth is that possible  yes it is that is perfect thank you for that are you um john are you in a private place where you are   ok to speak at the moment **** perfect thank you for that   ok so tell me what the problem is you have been having some difficulty breathing is that correct right   ok so when did this bee sting or bee bite occur right   ok um and your your lips do not seem swollen to me right now but do they which can you show me with your finger where you feel it is swollen sure sure ok uh you said you have been having some difficulty breathing your breathing seems all right to me right now um the reason why i am clarifying   is because we have to decide whether this is a an acute emergency whether i need to send you   in to hospital straight away or whether we **** more time to ask questions   ok so um do you feel like you have got difficulty breathing right now this minute as we speak sure sure sure no you uh you did the right thing and i and i can understand it it is quite anxiety provoking   ok all right can i just doublecheck before we carry on *** asking other questions have you got * history of anaphylaxis no   ok have you ever been given an epipen   no ok all right let let us um take a step back now so in terms of the bee sting it was a did you see   a bee or you are you are just um assuming it was a bee one of the two   ok and um the area of your body that it stung where was it did you say it was your arm all right and you have got a rash there can i have a look   ok all right that looks   ok to me right now does it look red to you at the moment yeah yeah yeah the puncture mark yeah   ok all right um now is is there any swelling around that area that you can see i i could not see any sure   ok     all rightum now have you taken any  medication it is probably a you probably have not   cause it was a few minutes ago but have you is ** not  taken any antihistamines or anything like that   ok now um if i can just go back do you have any history of any any kind of illnesses at all   ok   ok have you got a history of any allergies to anything all right good um and in your family is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute ******** reactions ** right and um do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that ** yeah and you have got no food allergies as far as you are aware   ok um can i ask do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that right   ok have you ever been on medication for that   ok um great now um i need to ask a few questions maybe not directly related to this but just it is for for general information purposes so um are you working at the moment what do you work as   ok and  um you living alone   ok do you have any pets at home    a cat ok great what i would like to do now if that is   ok john is i would like to have a look inside your mouth   ok   um one of the things that um we would be worried about if someone is going to have an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there is any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth or the soft tissues of the airway and um i can i have got a fairly good view of your lips but i would like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back mouth open wide sit somewhere where there is good lighting and i just **** wanna have a look inside the throat if that is ok perfect ok great now um um can can i just get you to do it again and just say ah this time ok fantastic brilliant ok um uh john based on um how you look how you are talking to me and how you are breathing and the appearance and your wrist um i do not feel that you are having a an an a lifethreatening uh allergic reaction now it is very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite it is uh it is a localised um uh inflammatory reaction that um is normal and that immediate reaction that redness and that ** maybe slight swelling is usually temporary what we are worried about is when someone has um compromise of their breathing so you mentioned breathing difficulties and  you mentioned swelling of your lip thankfully i can not see any of that right now but that is the most urgent and most pressing thing that we would be watching out for given that it has not happened initially it is unlikely to happen later   ok we so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites and usually if you are ***** gonna have   the reaction it will happen straight away so we may be coming out of the danger zone now it is um but i am just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that you when you are trying trying to breathe it makes like a rasping sound like this   ok thankfully you do not have anything like that right now it seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to  a and e um uh and in some cases if it is if it is uh progressing rapidly it is better to go straight to  a and e rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us   ok what i would like you to do now is i would like you to try and take some antihistamines so you can buy them over the counter you can get piriton or chlorphenamine and you can take one tablet four milligrams um up to about six times a day   ok or you can just take a oneaday one whichever is your preference that is that is absolutely fine there is no no issue that should be enough to control this um if the redness in your arm spreads and you it feels hot or you you know you have signs of any localised infection we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic and like i said if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing that is urgent and we need to process that *******   action needs to be taken urgently did you have any other um queries or was there anything else that you  are worried about yeah           that is that is over the yeah over the counter you do not need to any chemist will have it you do not need a prescription for that yeah it is probably cheaper to buy it           over the counter actually than to get it ** via prescription ok um now um uh on the basis of what you have told me i do not think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a a straightforward localised reaction to a an insect bite however if it was to happen that you know this you are you are having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other nonspecific rashes  we might need to think about blood testing i do not think we are at at that moment yet   ok so uh but that is something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern   ok then so we will leave it like that for now   ok i am ***** gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it i do not want you to panic but just for *** you to be aware ** what *** symptoms are if those kind of things happen get back to us if you are feeling worried just have a lower threshold for having a chat with us sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down all right then john   ok uh well we will leave it like that come back to us if you have any further issues my pleasure all right take care then all the best    bye bye\n",

******* *** *** ****** any other symptoms at all   ok all right um and um so you are having periods of when you are feeling hot and also periods when you are feeling cold as well   ok uh and have you been taking your medication sure and when you say it is not helping is it bringing the temperature down at all ****  ok alright and can i just double check have you gotten any cough or cold or sore throat or anything like that but which are you getting other than the ones you have already mentioned to me sure have you have you had any ear pain ok  um just i just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body so i am ***** gonna go through some um kind of systemic questions have you had any diarrhoea   ok have you got any neck stiffness at all   ok alright    um do you have any headache   ok   ok so you know your normal headache where is that in the back of your head or the front of the head   ok and how long have you been having that for   ok um have you    got any rash on your body anywhere at all uh any joints swollen or tender or sore **** ***    ok alright alright and um have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you are passing urine   ok any painful urination at all are you passing urine more often than normal   ok have you been abroad anywhere recently where have you been   ok uh and um uh did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there which one did you take was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet   ok um and was it one tablet or was    it another one that you would take on top of the first one   ok and and what were you doing out in vietnam was it just ******* seeing the cities or going through villages or hiking what what kind of activities were you doing   ok uh and um did you do any kind of were you in rivers or things like that were you you know how adventurous were you where you going out into the rivers were you going on beaches i mean how adventurous was your trip right   ok um thank you for sharing that with me now do you have um any other illnesses at ** all in the past and that back pain have you um have you seen anyone about that have they  have they give you any kind of diagnosis at all alright    um are there any illnesses in your family at all i am sorry to hear that um how old was he when that happened   ok um are you on any medication at all   ok uh do you have any allergies at all ** *** medication   ok so hay fever alright    um are you um you are working at the moment what do you work at   ok all right um and um you are up to date with all the vaccinations hepatitis b and that kind of thing   ok   so i can sure   ok um and are you a uh are you a smoker at all   ok and ohh do you drink much alcohol   ok and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally   ok that is good alright    um so um what uh i think we are ***** gonna need to do is we are ***** gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics examine *** and we are ***** gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well   ok um so what what i want to do is the first question **** i have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you have got this fever and these symptoms because there is no apparent reason from what you have told me there is no uh when someone has got fever and sweats we want to find out have they got chest infection have they got a throat infection um and if we can not find a focus of infection then that is something that that is an outstanding question that needs to be answered   ok um the second thing second factor is that you have recently come from uh vietnam and you have had exposure to rural areas and we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well so um you are probably ***** gonna need some blood tests after you have been seen by somebody um now the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you which is why we are going to go go for the examination first you *** come into one of our clinics in central london that is one option and then the the gp there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be or if it is inconvenient for you to come into central london because you you are living further out you could actually just attend a local  a and e i am going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of  test i think you need in the notes for this appointment so you could show that to them at reception um i will be asking for something called thick and thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers and things like those technical terms but they will understand what that what i am talking about but um i i do not think you can go into work uh until we have sorted this out and we we we need to sort this out sooner rather than later   ok ok fine so what i am going to do is i will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in and if you can ring the number that i leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes and then they will slot you in and then we can sort things out from there ****  ok alright then   ok take care then all the best bye\n",

just ****** doublecheck does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that they have been diagnosed with migraines   ok um and um are you under any particular stress at the moment right   ok um and um how long has that been the case for how would you say your mood is   ok do you have have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past   ok are you taking *** sertraline at the moment   ok um and how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment do you feel anxious at the moment   ok all right um now sorry to ask this * just need to ask this for anyone suffering from anxiety     do you have any have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself good i am glad to hear that um now with regards to this headache is it worse when you lie down or um is is is it better when you lie down   ok um so would you say ultimately it is better when you lie down or have you not   ok um and um in terms of um this headache since this morning have you taken anything for it yet  has that helped   ok taking anything else at all   ok um do you have any other illnesses at all have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure have you ever had your blood pressure checked   ok um and are there any illnesses in your family   ok all right and um are you on any medication ********** do you have any allergies to any medication     all right and are you living by yourself at the moment or *** *** living with someone else   ok are you a smoker   ok and uh do you have any pets at home   ok and can i just ****** doublecheck how much exercise would you do normally a week   ok and what is your diet like   ok all right um now um in terms of this headache uh obviously i have not been able to examine you or see you directly but um it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache ok that is one possibility um and what makes that more likely is the fact that you have been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past ok um the other possibility is um migraine as well ok um and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that it is on one side and that you have got some sensitivity to light   ok so what what i think we can do is um i think we can give you some um generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches   ok so i will tell you what it is in a second and the other thing that i was ***** gonna suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work so  um        the medicationwise the things that we would start off first line if someone had migraine was to would be to start ibuprofen and um uh that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses ** ibuprofen so that is one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like but the the ibuprofen is um actually more effective for migraine and um yeah so the the guidelines have changed recently we used we before that we used to give paracetamol as first line but now it is um ibuprofen or aspirin that is thing um the other thing i would like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work   ok because if the headache is due to stress from work um maybe having a week off if you ***   selfcertify that might help with things and i would also like you to explore counselling options as well so there is a counselling service in your area that i can give you the link for for you to selfrefer i would like you to ok i would like you to try that um what we are ***** gonna do is we will have a followup in a week is time as well as those two things other things i would like you to do is to try and ensure that you are having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep at night every night and you are drinking a minimum of um one point five to two litres uh of water or fluids a day and that is not including coffee or tea all right because sometimes dehydration and you know uh fatigue can be causes of headaches as well um yeah so it that that that is um you know we need to rule those things out um let us let us try that   ok um and let us have a followup appointment if we are finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or um look at uh other possibilities but we will try that in the first instance um if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse feel free have a lower threshold for ringing us back and      we can book you an appointment and we can reassess the situation   ok no problem so there will be a summary of all of this in the notes um and i will also leave a link to some of the    danger signs  of symptoms of headaches in the notes if you can read through that in your own time that will just help you to have a bit more control over what is going on and understanding of what what what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor no problem   ok so we will we will touch base in a week is time with me or myself or one of the other doctors and we ***** we will take it from there   ok brilliant   ok then all right take care then    all the best bye bye\n",

your bowels are they   ok yeah um your bowels how is your toilet   ok so you are not going to the toilet you are going like to be very more specific you do not have any diarrhoea   ok so there is ** blood in the poo no mucus nothing of that sort just **  now you mentioned nausea have you been ever sick with it   ok well just the nausea   ok is there any particular foods that make you nauseous   ok so you can not think of any real do you suffer from acid reflux   ok   ok you **** also mentioned that you are feeling short of breath so ** *** yeah is there ** *** **** any cough   ok yeah is it like in closed spaces so how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath so how far can you walk with no shortness of breath walk **  you start with walk do you feel short of ****** breathlet us start this way do you feel short of uh breath when you walk at all right you so you can walk about a mile and you do not feel short of breath at all   ok so just explain a bit more just ** make myself clear about the lift thing so you said you are short of breath when you are in the lift *** described       them like palpitations to me yeah so that is what you are you are feeling

underactive thyroids what symptoms you have said um it is the opposite that usually happens yeah it is for *** overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the racing of your     heart beat and

      "REF: hi ** ** sure my name is mary smith my date of birth is august sixteen nineteen seventy six my email address is      mary dot smith at    gmail dot com absolutely um well i think that is just like the first thing that i typed but uh uh it was not really what i you know i just typed it and then i clicked submit so that was uh um i mean it is part of the problem but i would say that more of a problem for me is that i can not quite move my left arm i mean i can move it but it is it is numb and then i also feel some like tingling in my fingertips yes yes so i have started taking this boxing class i have * **** been taking this boxing class for a few weeks and i feel like maybe um it is probably been i would say for at least two weeks and it is kind of gotten worse likein    the beginning i just kind of felt a little bit of a tingling and then it is gotten it is gotten worse since then then the numbing kind of started i can feel it both in my uh um you know a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand and now because it has not gotten better i tried to get a massage it is not better or you know   try to take warm baths it is not better so i figured i would call you and and just figure out what is going on uh well it is you know it is it is numb and i i kind of looked at stuff online um but you know i i do take ibuprofen **** because my muscles were sore a little bit and i have  been taking this boxing class so you know i kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand so that is been a little bit painful so i have just kind of taken ibuprofen for that but like i said i mean i tried massage i tried some hot baths and that did not help with this numbness thing i am just kind of getting a little worried and um well it is kind of funny you know sometimes i will feel it in my shoulder like if i try to if i try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff i will even like uh um maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain uh but i would say if i am just like resting if i am sitting like right now i can feel like it is numb and i i actually feel tingling right now not in all of my fingers just in some   ok so it is my second third and fourth finger no it is it is the it is this side so the front side yes so not so much with the glass but i will say um well i play a little bit of a piano and so i just noticed **** it is been kind of harder to get the notes i can i can grasp i can grasp a a glass but because i use my right hand most of the time you know i am not       left handed so it is kind of hard for me to yes yeah no no it is not hurting it is not hurting it is like numb i can not feel it right well yeah yes absolutely no not no nothing mm hmm well i guess because of this you know i am not sure if it is boxing i also had a really bad cold like a month ago i mean i was out you know drinking with  uh friends um one of our coworkers just had his     three year anniversary and we **** kinda went crazy and we were like out partying until you know late hours and i just got uncharacteristically drunk for me and then after that i was sick for probably good like two weeks i was at home i think i must have had some kind of like a flu or something so it is that and then i would say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like i all of a sudden just could not see from the  uh from my left eye like i i lost some like a little bit of a field of vision uh and but that that just lasted not very long i mean that just lasted maybe for i do not know twenty twenty minutes uh and i kind of thought i do not know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so i i guess that is what i can you know that is the last thing i can remember but in general i am i am pretty healthy * **** * you know i work out *  uh and i i do not really have any medical problems um sometimes i get headaches but i think they are just tired headaches you know sometimes i will get kind of tired but i think that is probably because i work too much or you know because like i will go for a workout and then i will really just exhaust myself and then i just kind of feel this fatigue uh or sometimes like this morning for example i just felt really fatigued and i could not even get myself to the gym but you know since i have this numbness it is kind of like hard to **** workout right no what is a seizure ohh no no no no ** nothing like that mmm mmm right exactly yeah yeah yeah walking is normal yeah you know i think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so it is almost like it happened and i thought ohh my god it is probably i am still like sick from this you know virus thing cold and so i just kind of slacked it off and then when i uh um when i woke up it was gone not really i just take ibuprofen every once in a while i take vitamin d um i take some i i like my **** my gp really wants me to take iron supplements but you know  they are just like huge pills so i  i most of the time i just forget but vitamin d i take and then sometimes i take melatonin to help me sleep i know that my dad has i do not know if it it   is hypo i think it is hypothyroidism um and

      "HYP: hi hi hi sure my name is mary smith my date of birth is august    16th     1976 ******* *** my email address is marysmith *** ***** at gmailcom *** *** absolutely ** well i think that is just like the first thing that i typed but ** ** it was not really what i you know i just typed it and then i clicked submit ** that was  a um i mean it is part of the problem but i would say that more of a problem for me is that i can not quite move my left arm i mean i can move it but it is it is numb and then i also feel some like tingling in my fingertips yes yes so i have started taking this boxing class i have i have been taking **** boxing class for a few weeks and i feel like maybe um it is probably been i would say for at least two weeks and it is kind of gotten worse   like eating ********* i just kind of felt a little bit of * tingling and then it is gotten it is gotten worse since then then the numbing kind of started i can feel it both in my ** um you know a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand and now because it has not gotten better i tried to get a massage it is not better or you know tried to take warm baths it is not better so i figured i would call you and *** just figure out what is going on ** well it is you know it is ** ** numb and i * kind of looked ** stuff online ** but you know i * do take ibuprofen just because my muscles were sore a little bit and i have taken ****** this boxing class so you know i kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand so that is been a little bit painful so i have just kind of taken ibuprofen for that but like i said i mean i tried massage i tried some hot baths and that did not help with this numbness thing i am just kind of getting a little worried *** ** well it is kind of funny you know sometimes i will feel it in my shoulder like if i try to if i try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff i will even like ** ** maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain ** but i would say if i am just like resting if i am sitting like right now i can feel like it is numb and i * actually feel tingling right now not in all of my fingers just in some okay so it is my second third and fourth finger no it is ** ** *** ** ** this side so the front side yes so not so much with the glass but i will say ** well i play a little bit of a piano and so i just noticed that it is been kind of harder to get the notes i can i can grasp i can grasp a * glass but because i use my right hand most of the time you know i am not lefthanded ****** so it is kind of hard for me to yes yeah no no it is not hurting it is not hurting it is like numb i can not feel it right yeah yeah *** absolutely ** *** ** ******* ** *** **** i guess because of this you know i am not sure if it is boxing i also had a really bad cold like a month ago i mean i was out you know drinking with the friends ** one of our coworkers just had his threeyear **** anniversary and we kind    of went crazy and we were like out partying until you know late hours and i just got uncharacteristically drunk for me and then after that i was sick for probably good like two weeks i was at home i think i must have had some kind of like a flu or something so it is that and then i would say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like i all of a sudden just could not see from the for **** my left eye like i * lost some like a little bit of a field of vision ** and but that that just lasted not very long i mean that just lasted maybe for i do not know     20     20 minutes ** and i kind of thought i do not know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so i * guess that is what i can you know that is the last thing i can remember but in general i am i am pretty healthy i mean i you know i work out a lot and i i do not really have any medical problems um sometimes i get headaches but i think they are just tired headaches you know sometimes i will get kind of tired but i think that is probably because i work too much or you know because like i will go for a workout and then i will really just exhaust myself and then i just kind of feel this fatigue ** or sometimes like this morning for example i just felt really fatigued and i could not even get myself to the gym but *** **** since i have this numbness it is kind of **** hard to work     out right no what is a seizure  oh no no no no no nothing like that *** *** ***** ******* yeah yeah yeah walking is normal yeah you know i think it was only maybe like     20 minutes or so it is almost like it happened and i thought *** my god it is probably i am still like sick from this you know virus thing cold and so i just kind of   slept it off and then when i ** ** when i woke up it was gone not really i just take ibuprofen every once in a while i take vitamin d ** i take some i * like my jeep my gp really wants me to take iron supplements but you know there are this like huge  bill so i am most of the time i just forget but vitamin c i take and then sometimes i take melatonin to help me sleep i know that my dad has i do not know if it is high   oh i think it is hypothyroidism ** and then my like he is got ** ** *** some autoimmune stuff going on like that much i know and then my mom my mom she is she is actually not in a great shape she is got diabetes type   2 she is got hypertension ** she is got gosh what is it  oh yeah she is got high cholesterol ** and i think that is it for her yeah okay thank you what do you think may be going on  oh *** my god will i be in a wheelchair yeah okay okay okay i see yeah yeah yeah yeah i am here i am here yeah all   right yeah that makes sense well what is okay so you are going    to do the referral ** should i be taking any drugs or yeah okay *** yes okay okay got it sounds good okay ***** *** doctor thank you doctor appreciate your time thank you bye bye\n",

anything at all ********* **   ok right any allergies no allergies at all ***** righty fine so obviously you know you just have  diarrhea it is about four to five times a day um you are still drinking plenty and you look like you are not dehydrated which is a good sign   ok   um when we start worrying about  diarrhea is if you are going more than eight times a day that means probably you are you know whatever you are eating is going straight through   ok you still need to drink plenty of water because you are losing a lot of fluids   ok when you go to the toilet um things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while you are having the diarrhea go sorry   ok so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things that is easily digested like what we   are good give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you do not give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so that is the kind of soft diet we are talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash once you are   ok with that for about fortyeight hours then you can start having meat so just do not have meat *********** once you feel like you are slightly better because you might go back to square one again all right ***** fortyeight hours you are not having any diarrhea you are fine then you can go and start having meat egg fish and all **** so that ** **** *** **** no no no *** preferably just do not because what why do we say this it is because it takes much more time for meat to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food while it does not take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense yeah so um at the same time you could have some although you can not milk is not a good idea yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it   help to build up the normal um gut gut bacteria back   ok so those **** kinda now things to look out for if your diarrhoea does not go away in a week is time or if you are passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you you may have um some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics   ok if you are again as i have mentioned previously if you are going about six to eight times a day that means there is a high chance that uh you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens you get in touch with us again all right any questions you look a bit confused yeah   ok and also you could get something called dioralyte over the counter so it helps to uh replenish your the salts that you have been that is lost through going to the toilet   ok if you are a bit confused you know you can actually uh all this is all recorded in your app so you can go back i will put that all in detail so if you know i know sometimes it is a bit difficult to process everything you can go back and read read the notes is that   ok all right then you take care bye now    bye bye\n",

help today   ok so it started this morning was it a sudden onset headache did it come on suddenly   ok and did it come on really bad or did it start off uh like a slight headache and build up to a a severe headache and if if ten is the worst pain you have ever felt in your life how bad would you say the pain   was between one and ten  it  is not ten great  ok no that is fine have you ever had a headache before have you ever had a headache like this in the past   ok so it is   a first **** *** **** *** *       ok   ok if you had to say where uh uh across the head uh the headache is is it across the front around the back and tell me what visual problems are you getting   ok   ok and um have you tried any painkillers for this already   ok um ok um what time did you take the ******* paracetamol how long ago was it you  would taken it   ok um and your visual  problem  is still ongoing now   ok   ok um so what about have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit still feel all right   ok you have mentioned in the past you have had kidney stones any other medical problems uh you have mentioned that in the past you have had kidney stones have you had any *** other medical problems in the past what else do you have in the family ohh can you still hear me ohh it is gone you can hear me um you said you mentioned your mother has migraines what else do you have in the family   hyperthyroid   ok  bye   ok um and no other relevant family history and do you take any regular medications are you allergic to any medications   ok is there any chance you could be pregnant **** fine and so you are not allergic to any medications fine from and what what were you thinking might be going on i know you seemed quite worried about it was there anything in particular you were worried about   ok   ok fine um now just uh another uh question have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs anything like that uh and when you are walking you are able to walk fine in a straight line or is your your uh walk are you walking a bit funny   ok   ok so just just to clarify what what you said this morning uh you woke up and then later on in the in the morning about four hours ago you have developed a headache um on the left side of the head left side of the head is it behind the eye is it behind the eye is that where the pain is   um you have ok that is fine you have noticed that your vision is blurry there is funny lines you feel a bit nauseous you vomited twice um and  uh you feeling dizzy as well but your you have got no neurological symptoms you are walking fine um and and you have taken paracetamol and it has not helped   is that all ok so it sounds like what you are suffering from is what is known as a migraine is that something you have heard of before   ok   ok so um usually with with migraines they can present at different times in people is lives so sometimes they can present as a child sometimes they can present when they are older um and sometimes they can present you know even postmenopausally so there is different there is different ways you can get migraines uh and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it is on one side of the head ***** ** typical of a migraine you have got blurry vision again which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting that is also typical of a migraine now um uh obviously if the headache is really severe and i will suggest some medications you can try if that does not work we would want to see you um as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well to make sure that you know there is you know when we do a more specific examination that um everything all seems fine um i i would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you uh if you take some medications maybe something like ibuprofen so yes a migraine yeah  no you know even sooner than that we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes depending on what your response to it is for some people uh whatever medications they take the migraine does not improve um and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours migraines can last *** * ***** um       but no so what there is lots of medication treatments so there is it can be ibuprofen with an antisickness um so and which you can get *** from the pharmacy um and you also to drink uh sugary and carbonated drinks something like coke for the three of them is uh is a good sort of cocktail to start them then we can go up the treatment ladder you can get specific   migraine relief medication and that should   be something to try between now and when we see you to do the um to do the assessment assessment to where we can see you today at some point and but however if you do take these medications and you know by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself you can cancel it um you can give us a call and cancel it   ok uh any any questions for me all right   ok um any any further problems between now and your appointment please do let us know   ok bye ***\n",

tomorrow how long ago was it you taking ***** it okay ** and your visual problems are still ongoing now okay okay ** so what about have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit ***** **** all right okay you have mentioned in the past you have had kidney stones any other medical problems ** you have mentioned that in the past you have had kidney stones have you had any and their medical problems in the past what else do you have in the family  oh can you still hear me  oh it is gone you can hear me ** you said you mentioned your mother has migraines what else do you have in the family hypothyroidism okay fine okay ** and no other relevant family history and do you take any regular medications are you allergic to any medications okay is there any chance  he could be pregnant okay fine and so you are not allergic to any medications fine **** and what **** were you thinking might be going on i know you seemed quite worried about it was there anything in particular you were worried about okay okay fine ** now just ** another ** question have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs anything like that ** and when you are walking you are able to walk fine in a straight line or is your **** ** walk are you walking a bit funny okay okay so just **** to clarify what **** you said this morning ** you woke up and then later on in the ** *** morning about four hours ago you have developed a headache ** on the left side of the head left side of the head is it behind the eye is it behind the eye is that where the pain is okay *** **** ** that is fine you have noticed that your vision is blurry there is funny lines you feel a bit nauseous you vomited twice ** and you are feeling dizzy as well but **** you have got no neurological symptoms you are walking fine ** and *** you have taken paracetamol and it has not helped okay **** *** ** so it sounds like what you are suffering from is what is known as a migraine is that something you have heard of before okay okay so ** usually with **** migraines they can present at different times in people is lives so sometimes they can present as a child sometimes    i can present when they are older ** and sometimes    i can present you know even postmenopausally so there is different ***** ** ********* ways you can get migraines ** and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it is on one side of the head which is typical of a migraine you have got blurry vision again which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting that is also typical of a migraine now ** ** obviously if the headache is really severe and i will suggest some medications you can try if that does not work we would want to see you ** as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well to make sure that you know there is you know when we do a more specific examination that ** everything all seems fine ** i * would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you ** if you take some medications maybe something like ibuprofen so yes a migraine yeah not you know even sooner than that we can look at maybe half an hour to    40 minutes depending on what your response to it is for some people ** whatever medications they take the migraine does not improve ** and   it can last from anywhere from four hours to      72 *** hours migraines can last but i would be something no so **** there is lots of medication  treatment so there ** ** can be ibuprofen with an antisickness ** so *** which you can get get from the pharmacy ** and *** also to drink  a sugary *** carbonated  drink something like coke  so the three of them is ** ** a good sort of cocktail to start them then we can go up the treatment ladder you can get specific migraleave ****** medication and that     is just something to try between now and when we see you to do the ** ** ** *** assessment ********** ** where we can see you today at some point *** *** however if you do take these medications and *** **** by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself you can cancel it ** you can give us a call and cancel it okay ** any *** questions for me all right okay ** any *** further problems between now and your appointment please do let us know okay bye you\n",

hours um and so you  are born in ninety two so that makes you twenty six um and you are uh any shortness of breath at all with that uh any cough wheeze slight cough yeah sore throat runny nose sore ears mmhmm are you feeling better now other than the tight chest right   ok   ok but you  now now you have got this this um so you have still got still got uh symptoms of a cold essentially uh ooh yeah ok and are you coughing up anything and um do you have any other medical problems like asthma **** ok you have any inhalers or any any medications yeah clenil   clenil modulite yeah   ok and um uh have you been using clenil and the ventolin and how often have you been using them both of them yeah sure ****   ok  all right all right so so so you have you have not got any clenil or any ventolin at the moment   ok all right um and any drug allergies that you know of   ok great now uh do you anyone in *** your family have any medical problems that you know of  hmm ok um right so just uh do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or um hopes for this consultation yeah absolutely i can i can imagine um well it certainly sounds like uh you have you have had this cold so you have got wheezy with a cough um and it is nonproductive cough and you are short of breath uh is the cough worse at ***** nighttime yeah ok and you have got this tight tight chest but you you would not say you have got chest pains    it is more of a tight chest is ***    it yeah sure   um ok well i i would quite like to uh certainly get you some uh ventolin clenil modulite have you had asthma exacerbations in the past yeah have you ever been to hospital uh as an inpatient as in you know stayed in there overnight for asthma ohh   ok so you so so you uh you you went to hospital and had a a so you stayed in hospital for a few days did you with an asthma exacerbation   ok but currently you are just on ventolin and clenil and you have not got any of those steroids uh those inhalers at the moment ok when sorry how old were you when you had that severe    asthma  exacerbation sure ok um just to quantify how short of breath you are um i do not suppose you have got a peak flow with you no you will not have will you um are you able to uh like walk up flights of stairs   ok walk on the flat   ok without getting  to short of breath or um are you short of breath at rest sure yeah   ok but you are not short of breath at rest at the moment   ok fine so what what i think um and just to just to go over is there anything you   had hoped about getting other than the uh a prescription for your inhalers was there anything else **** you would hoped about getting from this sure yeah no absolutely well i am really glad you have talked to me today i think what we can do is is give you a prescription for uh some more of the inhalers we can get that to you within the hour i would hope um and uh i think what the other thing i would like to do is just give you a dose of steroids so this is these are tablets which um you can take for five days uh two tablets in the morning and uh that should just dampen down your asthmatic response   ok um now there are some side effects to the steroids which i should really tell you about but please read the label that is associated with do not be too worried about the side effects they are most you know most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and ***       uh you have you had them in the past do you know of have you had steroids in the past probably yeah i would too so um they they can come they can make you your mood change can be slightly low or too slightly high can give you a high blood sugar um and   uh their uh they can also cause rash nausea um headaches but mostly ** is **** welltolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot um uh what i would like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your       uh inhalers ongoing so you um you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can you can use the clenil modulite in the morning with ventolin as a prn so a ventolin when you need to um when you are getting wheezy if you should start to use the ventolin more than uh every three hours uh at  at anytime it is a good idea to seek medical attention so um see a doctor um in some capacity uh and the other thing i would like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better have you do you know what a spacer is have you used one before have you got one   ok all right well um i will send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it but essentially uh couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out um uh for five or five or ten breaths uh yeah so uh was there anything else that was on your mind or you are concerned about at this stage   ok and and uh i might give you some time off work as well you can selfcertify first seven days but uh i think i would advise you just to rest a little bit until you are feeling a bit better if you are   ok with that all right ok no worries any deterioration in your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath um or just generally concerning symptoms uh pain in your chest tightness uh feeling lightheaded uh then seek further medical attention anytime please   ok   ok thank you bye bye\n",

have been feeling really anxious over the past few months um i just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it is started to really worry me and just add up and build up on that anxiety and i just did not know who to talk to or so i wanted to check with my gp um i guess so i think um i would say maybe about two months or so i have been feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting a new job um which i i would say it is quite i mean every job is stressful and when you first start but it is been really stressful i think over the past two months definitely um so i work for a a a fashion retailer in um the head office team and it is just a brand new sector i have never worked in retail before my boss is not very nice to me and i do not but i also think that it is just been i just really dread going there i just hate speaking to her i hate like seeing everyone and really worried about whether i am doing well or not and it is really impacting on like on the rest of my life like my sleep and *** stuff like that right yeah this is really so i i i have as i say like i do not want to go to work in the morning so i just find no way of i can not get out of bed but it is also because when i leave i just when i have left work i just feel so stressed and so worried about everything i have done i can not get to sleep for hours and hours and hours so i about ten eleven probably not for ages i am i am lying awake all night mmm so i find my my heart kind of racing and then i am just like panicking that i am gonna be late and that that is gonna make work even more stressful so i do have an alarm but i find myself waking up before that   cause i am just my heart is racing and actually the other day i was just like i was lying in bed and i really thought my heart was racing so much i thought i was gonna have a heart attack in the morning i just i can not even tell because i feel like i am even when i am in sleep it is such a shallow sleep but maybe three four hours i am getting now probably not significant changes maybe no i would not say that i would not say that i am eating like much differently ohh  that i probably have more chocolate than normal just because i feel so down yeah yeah so um it is it is usually kind of like when i realise in the morning that either um i feel like i am gonna be late because i have like overslept   cause i am so tired um or i wake up in a panic thinking i am gonna be late so it is just ** ** kind of like just a constant like rapid heart beating it is just really really stressful i do not know if it is stress or if or i did think it was like a heart problem    really actually irregular i think ohh it can be anything i think ** *** * couple of minutes or the other day i was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like ten minutes yeah but i would say this is only in the past sort of like couple of months as i say that i have been experiencing this no um well yeah it is painful to when the heart when my heart is beating fast but but yeah it is just really really low i mean i i am finding now that i am just i find no enjoyment at all it is kind of daytoday and anything that i am doing it is not just my job it is you know when i leave i am just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not it is not enjoyable and i am like yeah on edge the whole time well right now i am i am working so late     and everything is really really stressful so i do not really get much time  to myself but when i do **** wanna go out or you know see friends or just relax it it seems quite difficult to do that i avoid them ** ** insomuch that i feel like i am yeah so i mean sometimes it just i know that i am not ***** gonna have fun because i do not want to go out and do things that i would normally have done yeah as i say like everything that i **** had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with like i did used to like to like go running and and to play tennis and stuff but now it is just not i am just not enjoying it   i am not i am not like i am not going out to do that quite so much no   cause i think that would just add to the tension but i do like pretty much every morning i * think ohh i should call in sick or like *** just not go um no i would not say so i think i have always managed to make it to work but i i wonder if it is building up so this is why i wanted to call ** i am just worried it is building up to that and i do not know what to do   cause i have feel it felt it get worse and worse over the past couple of months yeah i mean i find public transport really stressful ** * anyway especially being on the tube      it is cause it is quite getting warmer so it is just really airless um but i think the majority of it   cause my life is just so focused around work right now the majority of it is focused around work as well not really i i am no i

      "HYP: hi yeah ** my name is valerie **** my date of birth is the       19th of september     1993 ****** ***** my address is at    64 **** cliveden place in south wimbledon yes i am yeah ** i have been feeling really anxious over the past few months ** i just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it ** started to really worry me and just add up and build up on that anxiety and i just did not know who to talk to ** so i wanted to check with my gp ** i guess so i think ** i would say maybe about two months or so i have been feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting a new job ** which i * would say it is quite i mean every job is stressful *** when you first start but it is been really stressful i think over the past two months definitely ** so i work for a * * fashion retailer in ** the head office team and it is just a brand new sector i have never worked in retail before my boss is not very nice to me *** * ** *** but i also think that it is just been i just really dread going there i just hate speaking to her i hate **** seeing everyone and really worried about whether i am doing well ** *** and it is really impacting on like on the rest of my life like my sleep and and stuff like that right  yes **** ** ****** so i * * **** as i say like i do not want to go to work in the morning so i just find no way ** i can not get out of bed but it is also because when i leave i just when i have left work i just feel so stressed and so worried about everything i have done i can not get to sleep for hours and hours and hours so * about  10     11 probably not for ages i am * ** lying awake all night *** so i find my ** heart kind of racing and then i am just like panicking that i am going to late and that that is gonna make work even more stressful so i do have an alarm but i find myself waking up before that because i am just my heart is racing and actually the other day i was just like i was lying in bed and i really thought my heart was racing so much * thought i was gonna have a heart attack in the morning i just i can not even tell because i feel like i am even when i am in sleep it is such a shallow sleep but maybe three four hours i am getting now probably not significant changes maybe no i would not say that i would not say **** i am eating **** much differently   i would * probably have more chocolate than normal just because i feel so down yeah yeah so ** it is ** ** usually kind of like when i realize in the morning that either ** i feel like i am gonna be late because i have like overslept because i am so tired ** or i wake up in a panic thinking i am gonna be late so it is just it is kind of like just a constant **** rapid heart beating it is **** really really stressful i do not know if it is stress or ** ** i did think it was like a heart problem initially ******** irregular i think  oh it can be anything i think it was a couple of minutes or the other day i was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like  10 minutes yeah *** i would say this is only in the past sort of like couple of months as i say that i have been experiencing this no ** well yeah it is painful to when the heart when my heart is beating fast but *** yeah it is just really really low i **** * * am finding now that i am just i find no enjoyment at all ** ** kind of daytoday  in anything that i am doing it is not just my job it is you know when i leave i am just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not it is not enjoyable and i am like yeah on edge the whole time well right now i am * ** working so late because everything is really really stressful so i do not really get much time for myself but when i do want    to go out or you know  be friends or just relax it ** seems quite difficult to do that i avoid them in so     much that i feel like i am yeah so i mean sometimes it just i know that i am not going    to have fun because i do not want to go out and do things that i would normally have done yeah as i say like everything that i have had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with like i did used to like to like go running and  um to play tennis and stuff but now it is just not i am just not enjoying it and ** *** i am not like i am not going out to do that quite so much no because i think that would just add to the tension but i do **** pretty much every morning i i think  oh i should call in sick or like let   us not go ** no i would not say so i think i have always managed to make it to work but i * wonder if it is building up so this is why i wanted to call so i am **** worried it is building up to that *** i do not know what to do because i have **** ** felt it get worse and worse over the past couple of months yeah i mean i find public transport really stressful in a    way especially being on the tube because ** ***** it is quite getting warmer so it is just really airless ** but i think the majority of it because my life is just so focused     on work right now the majority of it is focused     on work as well not really * * ** no i
