      "Recognized: OK. And how many times a day are you going, let's say over the last couple of days?\n",
      "Recognized: 6-7 times a day and you mentioned this mainly water tree. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools?\n",
      "Recognized: OK. And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Whereabouts is the pain exactly?\n",
      "Recognized: One side. And what side is that?\n",
      "Recognized: That's right. OK. And can you describe the pain to me?\n",
      "Recognized: OK. And there's a pain. Is that is it there all the time or does it come and go?\n",
      "Recognized: Does the pain move anywhere else because on between your back?\n",

      "Recognized: Measure your temperature then.\n",
      "Recognized: OK OK. Any other symptoms like sweating or night? No. And any vomiting at all?\n",
      "Recognized: You stop vomiting again and would you vomit? I know it's not nice thing to talk about but was it just normal food colour?\n",
      "Recognized: Yeah. And there was no blood in your vomits, is that right? No. OK. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned the tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned the vomiting. Anything else that comes to mind?\n",
      "Recognized: OK.\n",
      "Recognized: OK, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat? Anything?\n",

      "Recognized: Thank you. Do you remember where you ate?\n",
      "Recognized: OK anyone else unwell with similar symptoms?\n",
      "Recognized: OK, OK, fine.\n",

      "Recognized: OK. And did you asthma well controlled?\n",

      "Recognized: OK, fine. And in terms of just your your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. In what way has it been affecting your life?\n",

      "Recognized: And you said, you mentioned you live with a wife and two children. Is that right? All right, just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all?\n",
      "Recognized: And do you drink much more of alcohol?\n",
      "Recognized: OK, so.\n",
      "Recognized: Normally at this stage I'd like to examine you if that's OK but but haven't listened to your stories. I think just to recap, for the last three days you've been having loose dual diarrhea, bit of tummy pain mainly on the left hand side and vomiting and feeling quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you're having this Chinese take away as well three days ago and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something.\n",
      "Recognized: Called gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Recognized: Which is essentially just the tummy bug or infection of your of your tummy.\n",
      "Recognized: Mainly caused by viruses, but they can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms.\n",
      "Recognized: At this stage, what what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics is really just making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking plenty of fluids.\n",
      "Recognized: There are things like diolite you can get from the pharmacy which it's it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins.\n",
      "Recognized: And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would soon recommend that first, you know, first couple of days. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, 2 tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I'll certainly advise you to take some time at work. Actually I know you're quite keen to work. I would say next to two to three days as clears from your system. Take some time off from rest.\n",
      "Recognized: You know, if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again.\n",
      "Recognized: Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms and we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your store so we can test that, etcetera, etcetera.\n",
      "Recognized: How's that sound?\n",
      "Recognized: Do you have any questions for me?\n",
      "Recognized: OK. Is, is the treatment plan clear?\n",
